Session Objectives

• Upon successful completion of this 

session, you will be able to: 

• Confidently answer customers 

questions, better qualify the customer 
for a comfortable migration to Electric 
and ease the anxiety around range 
and charging concerns.

The average commute distance for a single occupancy car journey in the UK is 19.5 miles (25) The average 
current UK fuel price is £1.45 per litre (petrol), and the average car consumption is 40 miles per gallon, 
resulting in a round-trip cost of £6.61 per day for car commuters.

At an average UK price of 28p / kWh plugged into an Ohme wall box, 40miles would cost approximately £2.64

▪ Touareg R (Phev)

Battery degredation.

The range is a measure of battery capacity relative to when it was new. In the same way the battery life 
of a smartphone diminishes over time, an electric car will offer a shorter range as it gets older.

A study found that the average decline in energy storage is 
That means an electric vehicle with a range of 150 miles will lose               miles of accessible range after 
five years. The rate of decline slows down in later years.

Battery degradation is the fact that any rechargeable battery loses charge over time

As always, it’s important to be open and transparent with the customer 

It’s also important that when discussing battery degradation to ensure 
the customer’s peace of mind by telling them about our comprehensive 
warranty package  

Comprehensive battery cover that ensures the customers peace of 
mind

› Battery quality and performance 
have improved 
› High-voltage battery warranty:
› 8 years / 100,000 miles 

From the 1st September all Volkswagen approved used BEV’s will receive a multipoint check and a 
battery health certificate, this will display the current battery health status. Volkswagen UK manufacturer 
warranty covers battery degradation to 70% over a period of 8 years or 100,000 miles, whichever 
comes soonest.

Octopus Energy

Octopus have designed a smart, green tariff especially for Volkswagen’s electric vehicle drivers, 
“Intelligent Octopus.”
Switching to this tariff before your vehicle arrives will unlock big savings on your home energy bill.

•Free miles in the form of a £90 credit on energy account when both electricity and gas are switched to 
Octopus.

•Additional savings of up to £106 when compared to a standard home energy tariff

•Six hours of 7.5p/kWh super off-peak electricity every night from 11:30-05:30am

•Fill up for a fifth of the price of a traditional car, keeping fuel costs around 3p/mile.

•Truly green electricity bought directly from renewable generators such as wind or solar farms, making 
Intelligent Octopus one of the greenest electric vehicle tariffs available on the market.

UK building regulation change

UK  Building  regulations  changed from 2022 to include  the provision for charge points

The UK government announced that new  EV charging requirements came into force in England in 2022, as part of 
an overhaul of the country’s Building  Regulations.

From 2023

• Every new home, including  those created from a change of use, with  associated parking must have an EV 
chargepoint.

• Residential  buildings  undergoing a major renovation which  will  have more than 10 parking spaces must have at 
least one EV  chargepoint per dwelling  with  associated parking, along with  cable routes in all  spaces without 
chargepoints.

• All  new non-residential  buildings  with  more than 10 parking spaces must have a minimum  of one chargepoint and 
cable routes for one in five (20%)  of the total number of spaces.

• All  non-residential  buildings  undergoing  a major  renovation that will  have more than 10 parking spaces must 
have a minimum  of one chargepoint, along with  cable routes for one in five spaces.
