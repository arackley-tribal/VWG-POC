            "marketingDescription": "<h1>TDI Diesel Engines</h1>\n<p>Our Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engines are responsive and fun to drive, as well as being very efficient. They offer more power, with great fuel economy, which all helps to lower emissions.</p>\n<h2>Why drive a TDI?</h2>\n<p>You’ll enjoy the savings. Economical fuel consumption, long service and maintenance intervals, plus low emissions, all combine to keep costs low.</p>\n<p>You’ll love the drive. Our turbodiesel engines offer exceptional torque even at low revs. This results in tremendous fun at the wheel, thanks to their effortless acceleration and sparkling performance.</p>\n<p>You’ll feel the power. High levels of pulling power over a wide rev range offer real driving pleasure.</p>\n<h2>What do we mean by TDI?</h2>\n<p>TDI identifies all our advanced diesel engines using direct injection and a turbocharger. TDI engines are economical and smooth with high levels of torque (pulling power) and good energy efficiency.</p>\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n<p> Fuel needs oxygen to burn and the engine has to be supplied with huge quantities of air to get enough. You can solve this problem with a bigger engine - or you can solve it with a turbocharger - as in the TDI. Driven by the exhaust gases, it squeezes air more tightly into the cylinders.</p>\n<p>After being drawn through the turbocharger the air is then cooled by passing it through an air to air intercooler (cool air takes up less space than hot air), before entering the combustion chamber where diesel is injected directly into the cylinders at very high pressure through a nozzle. It’s this intensive mixing of highly atomised fuel with the cooled compressed air that leads to better, more efficient combustion.</p>\n<p>Your driving experience is quiet and refined because effective sound insulation keeps noise to a minimum, while hydraulic engine mounts ensure smooth, low-vibration running.</p>\n<h2>What’s the result?</h2>\n<p>The great advantage of TDI engines is that they are very powerful, even at low revs, and economical across the entire speed range. As they burn fuel more efficiently they produce more power. What it means for you is much better performance, with more pulling power than you would get from traditional fuel injection systems. This efficiency also means that you save on fuel costs and emit less CO2, so helping to minimise your impact on the environment.</p>",

It uses sensors to monitor the progress of your wheels and the moment they start to slip, ESC takes over by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Applying the brakes to one or more wheels</li>\n<li>Reducing engine power if necessary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This fast, effective reaction stops skidding before it begins.</p>\n<p>Our Electronic Stability Control (ESC) detects critical situations at an early stage, and takes action to stop skidding and help bring your car safely back under control.</p>\n<p>It uses sensors to monitor the progress of your wheels. If they start to slip, ESC takes over by applying the brakes to one or more wheels and reducing engine power if necessary. ESC links to your car’s electronic systems, such as the anti-lock brakes (ABS) and engine braking control (EBC). It has sensors on the wheels and steering wheel, plus a yaw movement sensor.</p>\n<p>The new Comfort Braking Assistant, the latest form of Hydraulic Brake Assist (HBA), helps even unskilled drivers reduce braking distance by around 25 per cent. The ESC plays a further role, using electronic differential lock and traction control to help correct oversteer, understeer and loss of stability of the car. The result is optimum traction when rounding bends.</p>\n<p>ESC monitors your car at all times. As soon as something unusual happens - if a wheel loses grip, for example, or the car starts to slip, it helps regain control by applying the brakes to each or all of the wheels, and cutting engine power.</p>\n<h2>Sports ESC</h2>\n<p>Sports ESC lets you have a bit more fun than with standard ESC, giving you more control of your car and allowing a more sporty driving style before intervening.</p>\n<h2>Trailer stabilisation</h2>\n<p>The latest generation of ESC also offers trailer stabilisation. If it detects your trailer is starting to yaw, the anti-skidding technology automatically reduces engine power and applies the brakes to the right wheels dynamically, in phase with the yawing. This counteracts the snaking motion and stabilises the car and trailer. When everything is stable again the brakes and engine power return to normal control. The automatic braking process also turns on the brake lights to warn other drivers, even if the driver is not touching the brake pedal.</p>\n<p>Only when used with factory fit or approved accessory tow bars.</p>",

If it senses your car is drifting out of your driving lane it gently counter-steers the car back on line.</p>\n<p>Since many accidents are caused by cars leaving their lanes when the driver’s concentration falters, this innovative system makes driving safer and easier. The lane-keeping assistant uses a camera located in the rear-view mirror unit to monitor the road markings and prevent an unintended deviation. The system only intervenes if the indicators are not activated, so if you do want to change lanes and signal your intention, the intelligent system recognises this and switches off.</p>\n<p>When the system is switched on, Lane Assist automatically becomes active from 40 mph upwards. A camera built into the driver’s rear view mirror detects the lane markings and works out the position of the vehicle. If the car starts to drift off lane, the lane keeping assistant takes corrective action. If the maximum action it can take is not enough to stay in lane, or the speed falls below 40 mph Lane Assist warns you with a vibration of the steering wheel. Then it’s up to you to take correcting action.</p>\n<p>If Lane Assist is activated, a yellow control symbol, shaped like a road, lights up. As soon as the camera has analysed the road markings, this symbol turns green, showing the system is live. If your car then leaves its lane, Lane Assist takes soft and continuous correcting action. If you take your hands off the wheel, the system makes a sound and displays a message, making a takeover request.</p>\n<p>If you stop holding the wheel for longer, the function automatically turns itself off. You can counteract Lane Assist, if you wish, by softly steering against it.</p>\n<p>On selected models.</p>",

            "marketingDescription": "<h1>Auto Hold</h1>\n<p>Auto hold is an extension of our electronic parking brake system. It stops your car from accidentally rolling backwards when you’re stationary, or setting off on a hill. That means you won’t need to keep applying the parking brake manually, check whether you’ve applied enough braking pressure, or worry about rolling back as you prepare to move off.</p>\n<p>It’s convenient, more comfortable, and safer in situations where your car needs to be kept stationary with the engine running - in slow moving traffic, for example.</p>\n<p>The system is operated via the ABS/ESP hydraulic unit. When you brake your car to a stop, auto hold keeps the braking pressure you last applied. You can take your foot off the brake pedal and all four wheel brakes will stay on.</p>\n<p>If the ABS wheel speed sensors detect any rolling, the braking force is automatically increased until your car comes to a standstill again. This may be the case if, for example, you brake gently to a stop on a hill. As soon as you press the accelerator again and, in the case of manual gearboxes, release the clutch, auto hold reduces the braking pressure again.</p>\n<p>For safety reasons the function always has to be reactivated by means of a button to the left of the gear lever when the engine has been switched off.</p>",

Like when you’re driving around town for instance, or just coasting along in low speed areas. And that’s where the Active Cylinder Management (ACT) kicks in and intelligently shuts off the fuel supply to two of your engine’s cylinders.</p>\n<p>You probably won’t notice anything when this happens – it’ll be smooth running as always. The only difference will be a reduction in both your fuel consumption and your engine’s CO2 emissions. Depending on your driving style, you’ll be able to achieve lower CO2 emissions compared to the same engine without ACT.</p>\n<p>As soon as you need your engine to deliver more power, simply accelerate and ACT will discreetly reactivate the two cylinders. So you’ll be back to full performance and firing on all cylinders again. It’s that simple.</p>",

This begins a chemical reaction which removes the polluting oxides of nitrogen (NOx), converting them into harmless oxygen and nitrogen in a process known as Selective Catalytic Reduction, or SCR for short. SCR is only applicable to diesel engines and the more economically you drive, typically, the less AdBlue® you will use.</p>\n<p>The size of the AdBlue® tank fitted to your car will vary depending on which Volkswagen model you have, therefore the interval between top-ups will vary. In addition, many factors such as mileage, journey type, driving style and environmental conditions can influence how much AdBlue® is consumed. A passenger car can consume approximately 1.5 litres of AdBlue® every 620 miles (1.0–1.5 litres for the Passat and Passat Estate). The list below details the AdBlue® tank size and location for all Volkswagen models that use SCR.</p>\n<h1>How will I know if the system needs topping-up?</h1>\n<p>A series of warnings will be given via the driver information system, accompanied by advice/messages. The first message is displayed when the remaining range is approximately 1,500 miles, and is repeated every 62 miles until the range reaches 1,000 miles, at which point the warning turns amber. This warning is repeated every 31 miles and is accompanied by an audible tone. If these warnings are not acted upon, the warning turns red; once this happens the car will not restart once the ignition is turned off. This is not a fault, but a required feature of the system. If this stage is reached the system will need a full top-up before the car can be restarted. Further information is available in the vehicle handbook.</p>\n<p>Passat:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tank Size (Approx.) - 13 litres</li>\n<li>AdBlue® tank filler location - Next to fuel filler nozzle</li>\n<li>Initial warning of low AdBlue® expected to occur at - 4,000 to 6,500 miles or sooner*</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Passat Estate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tank Size (Approx.) - 13 litres</li>\n<li>AdBlue® tank filler location - Next to fuel filler nozzle</li>\n<li>Initial warning of low AdBlue® expected to occur at - 4,000 to 6,000 miles or sooner*</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tiguan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tank Size (Approx.) - 12 litres</li>\n<li>AdBlue® tank filler location - Right-hand side of luggage compartment</li>\n<li>Initial warning of low AdBlue® expected to occur at - 3,000 to 4,000 miles or sooner*</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Touran:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tank Size (Approx.) - 11 litres</li>\n<li>AdBlue® tank filler location - Next to fuel filler nozzle</li>\n<li>Initial warning of low AdBlue® expected to occur at - 3,000 to 4,000 miles or sooner*</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sharan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tank Size (Approx.) - 16 litres</li>\n<li>AdBlue® tank filler location - Left-hand side of luggage compartment</li>\n<li>Initial warning of low AdBlue® expected to occur at - 5,000 to 6,000 miles or sooner*</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Touareg:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tank Size (Approx.) - 19.5 litres</li>\n<li>AdBlue® tank filler location - Spare wheel well (in luggage compartment)</li>\n<li>Initial warning of low AdBlue® expected to occur at - 6,000 to 7,000 miles or sooner*</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*Distances are approximate and the warning light may come on sooner depending on driving style, journey type, engine and vehicle load and environmental conditions.</p>\n<h1>Why should I use a Volkswagen Authorised repairer for top-ups?</h1>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>AdBlue® top-ups at authorised repairers are extremely competitive and charged by the litre, so you only pay for what you need</li>\n<li>Authorised repairer staff are trained to handle AdBlue®</li>\n<li>AdBlue® tanks need special adaptors on fillers to ensure there are no spillages</li>\n<li>Volkswagen do not recommend keeping top-up bottles in cars</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>The top-up bottles supplied by Volkswagen have a capacity of 1.89 litres, and come complete with the adaptor nozzles that fit the Volkswagen AdBlue® tank.

            "marketingDescription": "<h1>Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with predictive cruise control, including Front assist, radar sensor controlled distance monitoring system, City emergency braking system, cruise control and speed limiter</h1>\n<p>The ACC system now also monitors speed limits and route data from the navigation system in order to automatically adjust vehicle speed. Until now, the system was implemented purely as a cruise control system that maintained a desired gap to the vehicle ahead: Set the desired speed, and done – the Adaptive Cruise Control brakes and accelerates the vehicle. As outlined previously, the new Arteon is the first Volkswagen that can also react to changing parameters along the route – within system limits. Here’s how it works: ACC utilises a radar sensor (for distance monitoring), a camera in the windscreen and the route information from the navigation system. Using the camera and the interconnected Dynamic Road Sign Display, the Arteon is able to \"see\" speed limits; it can even recognise city limits. The ACC adapts to these speed changes. At the same time, the vehicle determines its position and predictively adjusts vehicle speed prior to bends, roundabouts and junctions using the front camera and route information from the navigation system. The Front Assist area monitoring system with City Emergency Braking is permanently integrated into ACC. Working in combination with the automatically shifting DSG gearbox, the ACC will automatically set the Arteon in motion from a standstill in situations such as traffic jams or city driving. The adaptive cruise control is active at speeds ranging from 0 to 210 km/h.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adaptive Cruise Control, automatic acceleration and braking to maintain a specified distance to the vehicle ahead.</li>\n<li>City emergency braking, active in traffic at speeds up to 19mph, the system will boost brake pressure if required to help prevent a collision.</li>\n<li>Road recognition, using the front camera and route information from the navigation data, the system predictively adjusts the vehicle’s speed prior to bends, roundabouts and junctions.</li>\n<li>Front Assist, monitors the traffic situation in front of your car, warning you when you get too close and even applying the brakes, if necessary, to help avoid a collision.</li>\n<li>Speed assist, using the front camera, dynamic road sign recognition and route information from the navigation data, the system can ‘see’ speed limits and automatically adjusts to the speed changes.</li>\n<li>Speed limiter.</li>\n<li>Traffic jam assist, Stop and Go (DSG only).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The intelligent technology of ACC with predictive cruise control cannot overcome the laws of physics and functions only within the limits of the system. It is the driver’s responsibility to have full concentration and control of the vehicle, as well as ensuring appropriate speeds by observing the maximum speed limits and road positioning of the car at all times.</p>",

            "marketingDescription": "<h1>Why do we need this?</h1>\n<p>Did you know that overtired drivers cause up to 25 per cent of all accidents on motorways? These accidents tend to be particularly serious because the sleepy driver has no chance to react and take avoiding action. So giving drivers early warning they need to take a break is vital for safer travel.</p>\n<h2>How does the system work?</h2>\n<p>It monitors driver behaviour closely – noting any erratic steering wheel movements and lane deviations, for example - so it can judge the moment that you are starting to feel sleepy and need to stop. It also continually evaluates traffic signals on the road when you are driving at speeds of more than 40mph. and works out when it‘s time to take a break.</p>\n<h2>How does it warn the driver?</h2>\n<p>If the system detects that you’re starting to lose concentration it will alert you with a visual display on the dashboard and a warning sound. If you haven’t taken a break within 15 minutes, the system will repeat the warning.</p>\n<p>So it’s always up to you to plan rest breaks into your journeys, of course, but you’ll find our new Driver Alert System a helpful aid to safer driving.</p>",

This clever system uses an LED sensor, fitted behind your internal mirror, to detect the amount of rain falling on your windscreen and adjusts the wiper accordingly.</p>\n<p>You can also choose different settings, depending on how sensitive you want the rain sensor to be. If you choose the most sensitive setting the wipers will clean off just a few spots of rain, whilst the least sensitive setting will wait a little longer before starting to work. And you don‘t even have to worry about reversing. When the sensor is on and you select reverse gear, the rear wipers will automatically wipe away any rain.</p>\n<p>The sensor system consists of a number of infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and a central photodiode. The light emitted by the LEDs is reflected by the windscreen onto the photo sensor. The more drops of water there are on the windscreen, the less light the sensor receives. This information is passed to an electronic control unit, which adapts the wipe intervals of the windscreen wiper accordingly.</p>\n<p>And the design means that dirt, minor defects and ageing of the windscreen do not impair its efficiency. You’ll find driving in wet conditions safer and more comfortable because the rain sensor does the hard work, leaving you to concentrate fully on the road. It’s especially useful in situations when your visibility is suddenly impaired - while overtaking lorries on a wet road, for example.</p>",

Compact, and painted in the body colour, they blend in well and are barely visible. The sensors monitor a range of up to 150 centimetres behind and, depending on the model, in front of the vehicle. The system swings into action when you engage reverse gear, or at very low speed.</p>\n<p>It uses the principle of the echo sounder to detect obstacles and their distance from your car. If it senses you are too close it starts to sound an intermittent warning tone which gets faster the nearer you are. Get so close that a collision is imminent and the warning signal becomes continuous. If your car has a radio or radio navigation display this gives you extra help by showing exactly how close any obstacles are.</p>",

            "marketingDescription": "<h1>Proactive occupant protection – Front is standard / Rear is optional and is included with the addition of Emergency assist or Side Assist Plus options</h1>\n<p>Proactive occupant protection system. For the first time, the PreCrash sensors are not only able to react to car handling processes (for instance, as registered via ESC) and acute collision hazards from the front (detected via Front Assist), but also to hazards from the rear. The PreCrash system uses sensors of the Side Assist lane change assistant. The system uses radar sensors to continuously monitor the positions and speeds of the cars behind the Arteon. The proactive rear occupant protection system evaluates this data. It does this not only while the vehicle is in motion, but also when it is stationary (with the motor running or in start-stop mode); such as when waiting at a red light. When another vehicle approaches the new gran turismo, the system calculates the probability of a collision using data on the positions and speeds of both cars. If there is an imminent danger of a collision, the PreCrash assistance system reacts in the blink of an eye. The hazard warning lights activate immediately; at the same time all windows are closed to just a small gap (for optimal bolstering of the side airbags) as is the sunroof. While this is happening, the belt tensioners tighten the front seatbelts. Last but not least, the optional electrically adjustable front seats are aligned. The belts, head restraints and airbags are now able to provide maximum protection.</p><h2>Side Assist Plus</h2><p>The brand new Side Assist Plus feature comes with rear traffic alert. Radar-sensors control the warning system for changing lanes and blind spot, when you’re driving at 6mph or above.</p><p>The system notices fast-approaching vehicles in adjacent lanes, and provides a visual warning through a light placed in the wing mirror.</p>",

            "marketingDescription": "<h1>Upgrade</h1>\n<p>Upgrades allow you to make your Volkswagen even more connected. Simply using your car’s infotainment system or the Volkswagen Connect shop, you can instantly purchase navigation upgrades, driver assist systems, and more. You can view the Upgrades available for your vehicle below as a Mobile Online Services  primary user and conveniently purchase them directly online.</p><h2>Upgrades for  Connect ready vehicless</h2><ul><li>Navigation: Add navigation functions for your Ready 2 Discover infotainment system and enhance your vehicle with intuitive navigation. Activating these functions allows you to access integrated, intuitive navigation with a 2D map display for Europe and points of interest (POIs). Once activated in the vehicle, these functions are permanently available to you and do not require an Internet connection or a We Connect contract. As well as these handy offline functions, you can access additional useful online services with the We Connect Plus licence. The Online Traffic Information service keeps you, the primary user, informed of changes and hazards along your route almost in real time, while the Online Route Calculation service provides optimal and forward-looking route guidance. Online Map Update automatically updates your map material at regular intervals when your vehicle is online, when you select the ‘Share my position’ setting in your infotainment system.</li><li>Voice Control: By saying “Hello Volkswagen”, you enter into a natural dialogue – for safe and convenient control of selected telephony, media or navigation functions. Activate voice control for your infotainment system Ready 2 Discover or Discover Media and control numerous vehicle functions using your voice. After all, depending on the vehicle model and equipment, many selected functions can be controlled using your voice. This allows you to focus completely on the road and enjoy driving even more.</li><li>App Connect: With App-Connect, selected apps and content are transmitted directly to the display of the infotainment system in your Volkswagen and can be comfortably and clearly controlled within your line of vision. That makes it incredibly easy to access music, news, maps or audiobooks, for example. Volkswagen offers three interfaces for connecting smartphones, with numerous options: Apple CarPlay™, Android Auto™ by Google and MirrorLink®. Wireless use of Apple CarPlay™ and Android Auto™ by Google is also available as a We Upgrade function for the Discover Media navigation system and Ready 2 Discover. To avoid distraction, only certified apps can be started during the journey.</li></ul><h2>More We Upgrade functions for your Golf</h2><ul><li>Adaptive Cruise Control ACC: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) keeps to a constant pre-set speed of your choice, up to 130 mph. When your Golf approaches another vehicle in front, ACC adapts the speed automatically, keeping your pre-set distance from the other vehicle (within the system’s limits).</li><li>Light Assist: With the Light Assist main beam control system, you’ll see driving at night in your Golf in a whole new light. Light Assist uses a camera installed behind the windscreen to detect oncoming traffic or vehicles driving ahead and automatically switch between dipped and main beam (within the system’s limits).</li><li>Dynamic Road Sign Display: Dynamic Road Sign Display can detect speed limits, overtaking bans and hazard signs on camera (within system limitations) and show this on the multi-function display. So it’s easier to keep track of what's going on in traffic.</li><li>Mood Lighting: The expansion of the basic ambient lighting enables the interior to be lit according to mood, thanks to the individual choice of colour. Mood Lighting offers an expanded range of colours and a wider selection for creating lighting accents as a We Upgrade function. Whether you prefer cooler or warmer lighting, you’re in the bright lights of the big city or on a dark country road: on every trip, you can create a different atmosphere to suit you and your passengers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information on which We Upgrade functions are available for your vehicle and current offer prices, please visit <a href=\"https://www.volkswagen.co.uk/en/connected-services/we-connect/we-upgrade.html#we-upgrade-functions\">www.volkswagen.co.uk/en/connected-services/we-connect/we-upgrade.html#we-upgrade-functions</a></p>",

            "marketingDescription": "<h1>Tow bar with electric release, incl. trailer assist</h1>\n<p>Manoeuvring with a trailer can become a test of patience if you don't have much practice. This is because the trailer doesn't always react as you may expect - among other things, the steering is reversed. The steering angle is decisive for precise reversing, and the optional Trailer Assist manoeuvring system will take care of steering for you. First select the reverse gear, push the parking aid button and use the mirror adjustment switch to set the direction in which the trailer should be steered. Your car will now steer automatically while you just need to take care of changing gear, accelerating and braking. This means you remain in control at all times.</p>",
