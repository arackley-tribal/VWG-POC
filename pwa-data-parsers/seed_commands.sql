TSI Petrol Engines
==================

When you drive one of our TSI cars you don’t have to choose between performance and economy. TSI engines offer an enjoyable and involving drive.

TSI is our pioneering technology for petrol engines. TSI engines are compact, and high-powered. TSI technology blends the best of our TDI diesel and FSI (fuel stratified direct injection) petrol engines to give you excellent driveability and fuel economy.

Acceleration is instant, whichever gear you’re in, so overtaking is safer and you can power smoothly up hills with no delay. By adding a turbocharger and a supercharger to the fuel-injected engine (hence TSI).

The engine-driven supercharger operates at lower engine speeds with the turbocharger, powered by the exhaust gases, joining in as engine speed rises.

The result is excellent driveability, no turbo lag and outstanding performance throughout the rev range.',

TDI Diesel Engines
==================

Our Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engines are responsive and fun to drive, as well as being very efficient. They offer more power, with great fuel economy, which all helps to lower emissions.

Why drive a TDI?
----------------

You’ll enjoy the savings. Economical fuel consumption, long service and maintenance intervals, plus low emissions, all combine to keep costs low.

You’ll love the drive. Our turbodiesel engines offer exceptional torque even at low revs. This results in tremendous fun at the wheel, thanks to their effortless acceleration and sparkling performance.

You’ll feel the power. High levels of pulling power over a wide rev range offer real driving pleasure.

What do we mean by TDI?
-----------------------

TDI identifies all our advanced diesel engines using direct injection and a turbocharger. TDI engines are economical and smooth with high levels of torque (pulling power) and good energy efficiency.

How does it work?
-----------------

Fuel needs oxygen to burn and the engine has to be supplied with huge quantities of air to get enough. You can solve this problem with a bigger engine - or you can solve it with a turbocharger - as in the TDI. Driven by the exhaust gases, it squeezes air more tightly into the cylinders.

After being drawn through the turbocharger the air is then cooled by passing it through an air to air intercooler (cool air takes up less space than hot air), before entering the combustion chamber where diesel is injected directly into the cylinders at very high pressure through a nozzle. It’s this intensive mixing of highly atomised fuel with the cooled compressed air that leads to better, more efficient combustion.

Your driving experience is quiet and refined because effective sound insulation keeps noise to a minimum, while hydraulic engine mounts ensure smooth, low-vibration running.

What’s the result?
------------------

The great advantage of TDI engines is that they are very powerful, even at low revs, and economical across the entire speed range. As they burn fuel more efficiently they produce more power. What it means for you is much better performance, with more pulling power than you would get from traditional fuel injection systems. This efficiency also means that you save on fuel costs and emit less CO2, so helping to minimise your impact on the environment.',

BlueMotion Technologies
=======================

We developed our BlueMotion technologies to help reduce the impact of driving on the environment.

The badge identifies our most eco-friendly cars. The Polo and Golf BlueMotion, for example, have such low emissions you pay no road tax or London Congestion Charge.

BlueMotion covers a range of innovative fuel-saving technologies such as our advanced TSI and TDI engines and DSG direct shift gearbox. Then there’s brake energy recuperation, improved aerodynamics, longer gear ratios, low rolling resistance tyres and start-stop.

Recuperation recycles the energy normally lost during braking by storing and then using it for acceleration or starting, so saving fuel and cutting emissions.

The aerodynamic design of our cars produces less air resistance so they use less fuel. It also improves handling and means lower CO2 emissions.

Low rolling resistance tyres are fitted to most of our BlueMotion and BlueMotion Technology models. They need less engine power to move the car forward, saving fuel and helping to cut emissions, while still offering excellent performance.

Our efficient Start-Stop technology cuts emissions and saves fuel by automatically switching off your engine when waiting in queues or at traffic lights.

It all makes our cars very efficient – but still great fun to drive, we promise.',

DSG Dual-Clutch Gearbox
=======================

Our acclaimed dual-clutch gearbox (DSG) has two clutches with electronically controlled gear selection. DSG gives you:

*   Fast, smooth gear changes.
*   Lively handling with unbroken acceleration.
*   Safer driving with the power to get you out of tricky situations.
*   Improved fuel economy, even compared to a manual gearbox, for many of our new 7-speed DSG boxes.

''DSG is a groundbreaking ’two-in-one‘ concept. Available in 7-speed, it’s totally unlike a conventional automatic transmission. Twin electronically controlled shafts manage gear selection, always anticipating your next shift.

When you turn the engine on and select Drive mode, one shaft selects first gear while the second shaft puts the next gear on ‘standby’. As the gearbox changes to second, the second shaft is engaged and the original shaft reaches third. As you shift upwards the sequence continues in a series of seamless moves. Because power is simply switched from one shaft to another, not only are gear shifts silky smooth, but they are also very fast: each change takes less than four-hundredths of a second.

The DSG gearbox gives you a choice of two driving programmes: normal and sport. In sport mode, the DSG leaves it longer to shift up the gears.

DSG can be used manually, via the Tiptronic gearlever or the optional paddle shifts.',

    title: How ESC works
---

ESC Electronic Stability Control
================================

ESC predicts what your car is about to do. It uses sensors to monitor the progress of your wheels and the moment they start to slip, ESC takes over by:

*   Applying the brakes to one or more wheels
*   Reducing engine power if necessary

This fast, effective reaction stops skidding before it begins.

Our Electronic Stability Control (ESC) detects critical situations at an early stage, and takes action to stop skidding and help bring your car safely back under control.

It uses sensors to monitor the progress of your wheels. If they start to slip, ESC takes over by applying the brakes to one or more wheels and reducing engine power if necessary. ESC links to your car’s electronic systems, such as the anti-lock brakes (ABS) and engine braking control (EBC). It has sensors on the wheels and steering wheel, plus a yaw movement sensor.

The new Comfort Braking Assistant, the latest form of Hydraulic Brake Assist (HBA), helps even unskilled drivers reduce braking distance by around 25 per cent. The ESC plays a further role, using electronic differential lock and traction control to help correct oversteer, understeer and loss of stability of the car. The result is optimum traction when rounding bends.

ESC monitors your car at all times. As soon as something unusual happens - if a wheel loses grip, for example, or the car starts to slip, it helps regain control by applying the brakes to each or all of the wheels, and cutting engine power.

Sports ESC
----------

Sports ESC lets you have a bit more fun than with standard ESC, giving you more control of your car and allowing a more sporty driving style before intervening.

Trailer stabilisation
---------------------

The latest generation of ESC also offers trailer stabilisation. If it detects your trailer is starting to yaw, the anti-skidding technology automatically reduces engine power and applies the brakes to the right wheels dynamically, in phase with the yawing. This counteracts the snaking motion and stabilises the car and trailer. When everything is stable again the brakes and engine power return to normal control. The automatic braking process also turns on the brake lights to warn other drivers, even if the driver is not touching the brake pedal.

Only when used with factory fit or approved accessory tow bars.',

    title: How Lane Assist works
---

Lane Assist
===========

The Lane Assist system is like a friendly co-driver. If it senses your car is drifting out of your driving lane it gently counter-steers the car back on line.

Since many accidents are caused by cars leaving their lanes when the driver’s concentration falters, this innovative system makes driving safer and easier. The lane-keeping assistant uses a camera located in the rear-view mirror unit to monitor the road markings and prevent an unintended deviation. The system only intervenes if the indicators are not activated, so if you do want to change lanes and signal your intention, the intelligent system recognises this and switches off.

When the system is switched on, Lane Assist automatically becomes active from 40 mph upwards. A camera built into the driver’s rear view mirror detects the lane markings and works out the position of the vehicle. If the car starts to drift off lane, the lane keeping assistant takes corrective action. If the maximum action it can take is not enough to stay in lane, or the speed falls below 40 mph Lane Assist warns you with a vibration of the steering wheel. Then it’s up to you to take correcting action.

If Lane Assist is activated, a yellow control symbol, shaped like a road, lights up. As soon as the camera has analysed the road markings, this symbol turns green, showing the system is live. If your car then leaves its lane, Lane Assist takes soft and continuous correcting action. If you take your hands off the wheel, the system makes a sound and displays a message, making a takeover request.

If you stop holding the wheel for longer, the function automatically turns itself off. You can counteract Lane Assist, if you wish, by softly steering against it.

    title: How Auto Hold works
---

Auto Hold
=========

Auto hold is an extension of our electronic parking brake system. It stops your car from accidentally rolling backwards when you’re stationary, or setting off on a hill. That means you won’t need to keep applying the parking brake manually, check whether you’ve applied enough braking pressure, or worry about rolling back as you prepare to move off.

It’s convenient, more comfortable, and safer in situations where your car needs to be kept stationary with the engine running - in slow moving traffic, for example.

The system is operated via the ABS/ESP hydraulic unit. When you brake your car to a stop, auto hold keeps the braking pressure you last applied. You can take your foot off the brake pedal and all four wheel brakes will stay on.

If the ABS wheel speed sensors detect any rolling, the braking force is automatically increased until your car comes to a standstill again. This may be the case if, for example, you brake gently to a stop on a hill. As soon as you press the accelerator again and, in the case of manual gearboxes, release the clutch, auto hold reduces the braking pressure again.

For safety reasons the function always has to be reactivated by means of a button to the left of the gear lever when the engine has been switched off.',

Area View
=========

Area View enables drivers to see the entire area surrounding their vehicle. It offers a number of views, which you can select according to the specific traffic situation and the action you intend to take.

The all-round bird’s eye view of the area around the vehicle is provided by four cameras, which are discreetly integrated into the vehicle. The front camera is located in the radiator grille, the rear camera is fitted in the handle of the tailgate and the side cameras are accommodated in the side mirrors. The wide-angle cameras capture the entire area around the vehicle so that now the driver can even see into the blind spot.

In the bird’s eye view, touch operation can be used to select the four cameras to give detail views of the areas in front of, behind and to the left and right of the vehicle.

With Area View, you can see around corners. For example, when driving forwards out of a parking space or an exit you can see pedestrians and cyclists coming from the side. The cameras will show you other road users on the display of the radio navigation system before you can see them.

In the front view mode, there is a choice between the above, split view, the sole front view (one perspective) as well as the front view with help lines for parking.

In addition, Area View can be used for manoeuvres such as attaching trailers. The trailer view provides a line on the camera image, which accurately guides the driver up to the trailer hitch.',

    title: How Climate control works
---

Climate Control
===============

Our air conditioning and climate control systems ensure your journey is comfortable - whatever the weather outside. Air conditioning and climate control systems keep a constant, ideal temperature inside your car, ensuring you stay cool and comfortable at all times. Select the setting and it adjusts blower speed and operates the air distribution flaps automatically.

The system’s electronic control monitors key influences, such as the position of the sun and the outside temperature, and adds more or less cool air accordingly. Integrating the control unit into the CAN data bus means extra features can be added. These include the automatic switch to air recirculation mode whenever the windscreen is washed to stop unwanted smells inside the car.

Climate control also has a defrost function to clear fogged or iced-up windscreens. If the outside temperature is above the cooling system cuts in to dry the air before it is heated. It maintains a pleasant atmosphere in your car, keeping your powers of concentration sharp and your passengers more comfortable.

3 and 4 zone is available on selected models.',

    title: How High Beam Assist works
---

High Beam Assist
================

High Beam Assist dips your high beam automatically to improve driver control and safety for both the driver and other road users.

The system is automatically activated when travelling over 37mph with your dipped beams on.

Using a camera built into the rear-view mirror, the system automatically dips the headlights when it detects either oncoming traffic or vehicles ahead.

It is easier than constantly switching from high to dipped beam and safer too, giving you the best view of the road ahead without dazzling other road users.',

City Emergency Braking
======================

The City Emergency Braking system is an innovative safety technology.

Automatically activated at speeds under 18mph, it uses a laser sensor to detect the risk of an impending collision and automatically primes the brakes to make them more sensitive.

If the driver does not brake and a collision is imminent then the system applies them automatically.

Depending on speed and situation, City Emergency Braking can reduce accident severity and even avoid a crash.',

    title: How Rear View Camera works
---

Rear View Camera
================

A camera at the back of your car shows you what’s behind to make reversing safer and easier.

Our rear view camera lets you spot any obstacles behind your car - even moving ones - quickly and easily, thanks to the camera built into the boot.

The camera starts working as soon as you put your car into reverse gear. It shows the area behind your car on your radio or radio navigation system display offering you a clear reversing image with easy-to-follow guidelines. Superimposed graphic lines guide you to the optimal steering lock, guaranteeing fuss-free, smooth parking.

Using the rear view camera means you‘ll be able to manoeuver quickly and easily, even into the most difficult parking space. It also alerts you to low-down obstacles which parking sensors cannot always detect. The reversing camera is also a great help when you’re hitching up a trailer.',

    title: How Discover Media nav/radio system works
---

Discover Media nav/radio system
===============================

The Discover Media Navigation System combines excellent navigation features with in-car media Infotainment – all controlled from its easy-to-use 6.5" or 8“ touchscreen colour display^.

The 2D/2.5D navigation comes with European maps displaying a range of useful information, such as points of interest and speed limits. To help you avoid congestion, this system even offers you three routes – fast, short and eco-friendly – based on traffic messages.

With DAB/FM/AM radio\*, CD drive and multiple file playback from SD and AUX IN, you can enjoy listening to music on the four high quality 20 watt front and rear speakers. And Bluetooth telephone connection lets you make or receive hands-free phone calls with on screen status display. Discover Navigation also includes Car-Net Guide and Inform.

    title: How ACT works
---

Active Cylinder Technology (ACT)
================================

Active Cylinder Management (ACT) saves you fuel by switching off two of your engine’s four cylinders.

There are some situations when your car really doesn’t need all the power that’s available under its hood. Like when you’re driving around town for instance, or just coasting along in low speed areas. And that’s where the Active Cylinder Management (ACT) kicks in and intelligently shuts off the fuel supply to two of your engine’s cylinders.

You probably won’t notice anything when this happens – it’ll be smooth running as always. The only difference will be a reduction in both your fuel consumption and your engine’s CO2 emissions. Depending on your driving style, you’ll be able to achieve lower CO2 emissions compared to the same engine without ACT.

As soon as you need your engine to deliver more power, simply accelerate and ACT will discreetly reactivate the two cylinders. So you’ll be back to full performance and firing on all cylinders again. It’s that simple.',

Ambient Lighting
================

Ambient lighting bathes the interior of your car in subdued light when it gets dark.

LEDs light areas such as doors, footwells and decorative inserts. The pleasant, discreet lighting complements the white illumination of switches and buttons in your car, creating a stylish atmosphere.

When you’re driving at night, the glare-free light also helps you to find your bearings and locate things more easily.',

    title: How Front Assist works
---

Front Assist
============

Front Assist monitors the traffic situation in front of your car, warning you when you get too close and even applying the brakes to help avoid collision.

Judging the speed and distance of other road users isn’t always easy, so Front Assist does it for you. It uses radar sensors to measure the distance and relative speed of other vehicles ahead and provides you with an early warning system. If it detects a potential rear-end collision, Front Assist alerts you visually and audibly, while also preparing the brakes for emergency braking.

The city emergency brake function is active in urban traffic at speeds up to 19 miles per hour. If you don’t brake enough Front Assist boosts the braking pressure to prevent a collision. And if you don’t brake at all Front Assist automatically steps in and does it for you. It’s a bit like having an attentive front passenger beside you with their own brake pedal.

That way Front Assist helps you prevent an accident, or at least minimise the consequences.',

    title: How Driving Mode Selection works
---

Driving Mode Selection
======================

Driving Mode Selection enables you to choose different settings that will change both your car’s performance and your driving experience – all at the push of a button.

You can quickly and easily select one of the five driving modes using the touchscreen and change between normal, comfortable, sporty, individual or eco style. So depending on what type of driver you are and your driving situation, you’ll be able to tailor the car to your requirements.

Want to drive in a more environmentally friendly way with less fuel consumption and emissions? Eco driving mode helps you do just that by optimising your engine and gearbox performance to save fuel. And it even reduces your air conditioning’s power consumption too.

You can also set your car up for a sportier ride. Sports mode modifies the steering torque and produces a faster response with the accelerator pedal, steering and front lighting system. It also activates the seat belt tensioners and switches the dual-clutch gearbox DSG to position.

Individual mode let’s you customise settings according to your own preferences. So you can tweak things like steering and accelerator pedal response, dynamic cornering lights and adaptive cruise control.

Or for long distance driving you can enjoy your journey in maximum comfort mode.',

    title: How Cruise Control works

Cruise Control
==============

Cruise control makes long journeys safer and more comfortable by regulating your car’s speed for you.

Our cruise control system works electronically to help regulate your car’s speed. It reduces the stress on drivers and offers you more comfort on long journeys by keeping a constant speed. It’s particularly effective when you have to stay within speed limits for a long way - when driving through miles of roadworks on the motorway, for example - and cuts the risk of your speed creeping up by accident.

The system works by memorising and maintaining the speed you select. It’s very flexible, too. You can increase or reduce speed manually - to a defined value - and you also have the option of returning to the speed most recently memorised.

The cruise control system can be turned off simply by pressing a button or by pressing the brake or clutch pedals.

For safety reasons, the cruise control system should not be used in heavy traffic or in difficult road conditions, such as heavy rain or ice.',

    title: How Electronic Parking Brake works

Electronic Parking Brake
========================

Using our electronic parking brake couldn’t be easier. Just press the button and your car is securely parked and an indicator light shows to reassure you that the brake is on. When you‘re ready to drive off again just depress the brake pedal, push the button to release the parking brake and drive away.

It gives you more space in the car, too, because the conventional handbrake lever is no longer needed. That means more storage space between the front seats.

The electronic parking brake is operated by means of two geared electric motors on the rear disc brakes which when engaged will hold your car securely parked.

Indicator lights in the instrument cluster and on the button show when the parking brake is on, while an audible signal also tells you that the brake is being applied.',

    title: How Dynamic road sign display works
---

Dynamic road sign display
=========================

Dynamic road sign display gives you all the traffic sign information you need, so you’re always in the picture.

A camera in the mirror base records important traffic signs, such as speed limits and no overtaking signs and then informs the driver – so you don’t miss them.

The traffic signs are displayed on both the Digital Cockpit Display and the infotainment display. It also displays additional useful information. For example, the rain sensors detect when it’s starting to rain and monitors any speed restrictions in wet conditions.

Dynamic road sign display helps you comply with regulations and drive safely, reducing the probability of you missing speed limits and no-overtaking signs.',

BlueMotion Aerodynamics
=======================

The aerodynamic design of our cars produces less air resistance so they use less fuel. It also improves handling and means lower CO2 emissions.

The smoother the airflow over your car as it goes forward, the less drag there is holding it back and the less effort is needed to move the car forward. That means better performance and lower fuel consumption. That’s why we are constantly optimising the aerodynamics of our cars.

How we’ve achieved this:

*   The body is more steamlined and gaps between panels are narrower.
*   Headlights and indicators are combined.
*   Radiator grilles, underbody panels and spoilers are designed to reduce drag.',

Brake Recuperation
==================

Recuperation recycles the energy normally lost during braking by storing and then using it for acceleration or starting, so saving fuel and cutting emissions.

When you’re trying to save energy while driving it makes sense to recover it where you can.One way we’ve done this is to raise the alternator voltage when slowing down and braking. This increases battery charging and helps the car slow down. The alternator load is then reduced when accelerating to lighten the burden on the engine and cut fuel consumption.

Volkswagen way to ZERO
======================

We are faced by the greatest challenge in our company’s history. It is perhaps the greatest challenge in the history of mobility: we are addressing our responsibility for our share of global carbon emissions.

That is why we are committed to complying with the Paris Climate Agreement, with the goal of becoming a company with a net carbon-neutral^ balance by 2050. To achieve this, we will change things.

We will follow a new path.
--------------------------

And we want everyone to participate in this movement – by being able to choose from innovative drive systems. We want to give you options that will help you on your personal path to lower emissions. Only by doing this will we all reach our common goal.

That is our way to zero emissions. And it starts here.

The first Volkswagen delivered with a net carbon-neutral balance: The all-electric ID.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The all-electric ID.3 is the first Volkswagen ever that is not just produced with a carbon-neutral^ balance but which is also delivered to you with a carbon-neutral^ balance.

Manufacture and delivery of the ID.3 to the retailer is independently certified as net carbon neutral by TUV Nord. Net carbon neutrality is achieved through a combination of both emission reduction and off-setting unavoidable emissions. You can download the TUV Nord certificate [here](https://www.volkswagen.co.uk/idhub/content/dam/onehub_pkw/importers/gb/electric/research/sustainability/ID3-customer-CO2-TUV-certificate.pdf) This independent certification is audited and reconciled quarterly. It excludes use and life-cycle post-handover at the retailer.

For production, we rely on energy efficiency and the use of green electricity to avoid emissions wherever possible. In the meantime, the share of emissions during the manufacturing phase that are unavoidable in the short term will be successively reduced and offset through certified climate projects.

As the first climate protection project, we are supporting our partner Permian Global in the Kantigan Mentaya Project in protecting 149,800 hectares of Indonesian rain forest, which absorbs large quantities of CO2.

And after delivery? We are partnering with OVO Energy so you can enjoy affordable, zero-emission charging at home. [Find out more](https://www.volkswagen.co.uk/en/electric-and-hybrid/making-the-switch/charging/ovo-energy.html)

Important information
---------------------

^Carbon emissions will be avoided and reduced directly at Volkswagen where possible. Upstream suppliers are obliged correspondingly to avoid and reduce emissions. Carbon emissions that cannot be avoided and reduced at Volkswagen and by corresponding commitments in the supply chain will be offset to the equivalent amount in certified climate protection projects.',

How does the system work?
=========================

AdBlue®, a water/urea based additive, is stored in a tank (like diesel fuel), however, unlike fuel it is not injected into the engine, but directly into a specially modified part of the vehicle’s exhaust. This begins a chemical reaction which removes the polluting oxides of nitrogen (NOx), converting them into harmless oxygen and nitrogen in a process known as Selective Catalytic Reduction, or SCR for short. SCR is only applicable to diesel engines and the more economically you drive, typically, the less AdBlue® you will use.

The size of the AdBlue® tank fitted to your car will vary depending on which Volkswagen model you have, therefore the interval between top-ups will vary. In addition, many factors such as mileage, journey type, driving style and environmental conditions can influence how much AdBlue® is consumed. A passenger car can consume approximately 1.5 litres of AdBlue® every 620 miles (1.0–1.5 litres for the Passat and Passat Estate). The list below details the AdBlue® tank size and location for all Volkswagen models that use SCR.

How will I know if the system needs topping-up?
===============================================

A series of warnings will be given via the driver information system, accompanied by advice/messages. The first message is displayed when the remaining range is approximately 1,500 miles, and is repeated every 62 miles until the range reaches 1,000 miles, at which point the warning turns amber. This warning is repeated every 31 miles and is accompanied by an audible tone. If these warnings are not acted upon, the warning turns red; once this happens the car will not restart once the ignition is turned off. This is not a fault, but a required feature of the system. If this stage is reached the system will need a full top-up before the car can be restarted. Further information is available in the vehicle handbook.

Passat:

*   Tank Size (Approx.) - 13 litres
*   AdBlue® tank filler location - Next to fuel filler nozzle
*   Initial warning of low AdBlue® expected to occur at - 4,000 to 6,500 miles or sooner\*

Passat Estate:

*   Tank Size (Approx.) - 13 litres
*   AdBlue® tank filler location - Next to fuel filler nozzle
*   Initial warning of low AdBlue® expected to occur at - 4,000 to 6,000 miles or sooner\*

Tiguan:

*   Tank Size (Approx.) - 12 litres
*   AdBlue® tank filler location - Right-hand side of luggage compartment
*   Initial warning of low AdBlue® expected to occur at - 3,000 to 4,000 miles or sooner\*

Touran:

*   Tank Size (Approx.) - 11 litres
*   AdBlue® tank filler location - Next to fuel filler nozzle
*   Initial warning of low AdBlue® expected to occur at - 3,000 to 4,000 miles or sooner\*

Sharan:

*   Tank Size (Approx.) - 16 litres
*   AdBlue® tank filler location - Left-hand side of luggage compartment
*   Initial warning of low AdBlue® expected to occur at - 5,000 to 6,000 miles or sooner\*

Touareg:

*   Tank Size (Approx.) - 19.5 litres
*   AdBlue® tank filler location - Spare wheel well (in luggage compartment)
*   Initial warning of low AdBlue® expected to occur at - 6,000 to 7,000 miles or sooner\*

\*Distances are approximate and the warning light may come on sooner depending on driving style, journey type, engine and vehicle load and environmental conditions.

Why should I use a Volkswagen Authorised repairer for top-ups?
==============================================================

*   AdBlue® top-ups at authorised repairers are extremely competitive and charged by the litre, so you only pay for what you need
*   Authorised repairer staff are trained to handle AdBlue®
*   AdBlue® tanks need special adaptors on fillers to ensure there are no spillages
*   Volkswagen do not recommend keeping top-up bottles in cars

The top-up bottles supplied by Volkswagen have a capacity of 1.89 litres, and come complete with the adaptor nozzles that fit the Volkswagen AdBlue® tank. These are available from all Volkswagen Authorised repairers.

Important Information
=====================

*   AdBlue® is not a fuel additive. This is why there is a separate AdBlue® tank
*   If you put AdBlue® in your fuel tank by mistake, please do not start the engine, but contact a retailer for help
*   Put only AdBlue® in the AdBlue® tank; do not fill the AdBlue® tank with any other liquids
*   Prevent anything from contaminating AdBlue®
*   If small quantities of AdBlue® come into contact with the vehicle’s paintwork, for example, wipe them off and if necessary rinse the area with water

NCAP
====

All our cars go through a comprehensive programme of crash tests, before they are launched onto the market. NCAP’s tough independent crash tests are carried out on many of our cars.

Who are Euro NCAP?
------------------

Euro NCAP (The European New Car Assessment Programme) is a respected motoring standards body that carries out tough crash tests on new cars. These include front and side impact crash tests and assessments of child protection and pedestrian safety.

How do we perform?
------------------

The latest tests carried out by Euro NCAP awarded many of our cars with a maximum 5-star overall safety rating. To see the full details of each test visit the [Euro NCAP website](http://www.euroncap.com/en). As of 2009, Euro NCAP only releases one overall star rating for each car tested, with a maximum of five stars.

What does that mean for you?
----------------------------

Safety will always be a vital factor when you come to choose a new car. So checking your new Volkswagen’s Euro NCAP rating will give you extra peace of mind.

To see the full details of each test visit the Euro NCAP website at [www.euroncap.com/en](http://www.euroncap.com/en)',

    title: How Gesture Control works
---

Gesture Control
===============

With just a single hand movement, you can switch radio station, songs, or photos.– included with optional Discover Navigation Pro.

Small gestures can achieve a lot in everyday life, but also when it comes to gesture control in your car. This function makes it even more convenient to operate the optional Discover Navigation Pro system. It enables you to easily move around in the main menu and various submenus using a right-to-left swipe gesture to switch pages. For example, with just a single hand movement, you can switch radio station, songs, or photos. For each gesture, you use a colour code on the user interface to see where gesture control works and where it doesn''t - after all, the traditional control options are of course also available for use at any time. Included as part of Discover Navigation Pro.

Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with predictive cruise control, including Front assist, radar sensor controlled distance monitoring system, City emergency braking system, cruise control and speed limiter
=========================================================================================================================================================================================================

The ACC system now also monitors speed limits and route data from the navigation system in order to automatically adjust vehicle speed. Until now, the system was implemented purely as a cruise control system that maintained a desired gap to the vehicle ahead: Set the desired speed, and done – the Adaptive Cruise Control brakes and accelerates the vehicle. As outlined previously, the new Arteon is the first Volkswagen that can also react to changing parameters along the route – within system limits. Here’s how it works: ACC utilises a radar sensor (for distance monitoring), a camera in the windscreen and the route information from the navigation system. Using the camera and the interconnected Dynamic Road Sign Display, the Arteon is able to "see" speed limits; it can even recognise city limits. The ACC adapts to these speed changes. At the same time, the vehicle determines its position and predictively adjusts vehicle speed prior to bends, roundabouts and junctions using the front camera and route information from the navigation system. The Front Assist area monitoring system with City Emergency Braking is permanently integrated into ACC. Working in combination with the automatically shifting DSG gearbox, the ACC will automatically set the Arteon in motion from a standstill in situations such as traffic jams or city driving. The adaptive cruise control is active at speeds ranging from 0 to 210 km/h.

*   Adaptive Cruise Control, automatic acceleration and braking to maintain a specified distance to the vehicle ahead.
*   City emergency braking, active in traffic at speeds up to 19mph, the system will boost brake pressure if required to help prevent a collision.
*   Road recognition, using the front camera and route information from the navigation data, the system predictively adjusts the vehicle’s speed prior to bends, roundabouts and junctions.
*   Front Assist, monitors the traffic situation in front of your car, warning you when you get too close and even applying the brakes, if necessary, to help avoid a collision.
*   Speed assist, using the front camera, dynamic road sign recognition and route information from the navigation data, the system can ‘see’ speed limits and automatically adjusts to the speed changes.
*   Speed limiter.
*   Traffic jam assist, Stop and Go (DSG only).

The intelligent technology of ACC with predictive cruise control cannot overcome the laws of physics and functions only within the limits of the system. It is the driver’s responsibility to have full concentration and control of the vehicle, as well as ensuring appropriate speeds by observing the maximum speed limits and road positioning of the car at all times.',

Emergency Assist including emergency lane change assist - Driver intervention should sensors detect the driver is incapable of driving. Automatic hazard light activation while bringing the vehicle to a controlled stop within its lane. Only with DSG engines. Not in conjunction with Side scan
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Driver intervention should sensors detect the driver is incapable of driving. Initially by visual and audible warnings and a braking jolt. If no response, the systems initiate automatic hazard light activation while slowing the vehicle down, steering the vehicle into the left hand lane and bringing it to a controlled stop, traffic behind permitting. The Rear Proactive Occupant Protection system is enabled with this option. Only in conjunction with DSG Gearbox. Must be ordered in conjunction with Park Assist and rear-view camera.',

Dynamic Chassis Control (DCC) Allows individual tuning of shock absorption and other driving mode characteristics
=================================================================================================================

Choice of four preset modes: Eco, Normal, Comfort and Sport, as well as an Individual mode that allows up to 43 selectable stages.

For the first time the controlled shock absorbers can be almost infinitely adjusted across an expanded range from the individual settings submenu (Comfort+ to Sport+). Beyond the familiar ''Comfort'' setting, the driver can increase ride comfort even further by moving the control slider to the left (Comfort+); a setting that is sportier than the familiar ''Sport'' setting can be set by moving the slider to the right (Sport+). The driver can make adjustments between the Comfort, Normal and Sport profiles. Thus, the driver has the ability to choose a truly personalised setting.',

DCC Adaptive Chassis Control - For an individual driving experience
===================================================================

With DCC adaptive chassis control, your Volkswagen finds the perfect balance between comfort and sportiness. Adaptive damper control minimises unwanted rolling and pitching movements of the vehicle, maximising your driving pleasure.

The vehicle’s driving characteristics can be adapted to your needs. This includes, for example, a noticeably smoother ride on uneven road surfaces. You can switch from the sporty dynamic mode to comfort mode at any time.

Adaptive damper control uses sensors to read the road surface and the driving situation. The system uses these data to adjust the damping for each individual wheel a thousand times a second – faster than the blink of an eye.

If you want, you can even adjust your driving experience incrementally in the “Individual” menu.

Watch the video and discover how DCC with Adaptive Chassis Control helps your Volkswagen strike the perfect balance between comfort and performance.',

Digital Cockpit Pro
===================

Thanks to the optional Digital Cockpit Pro, you can enjoy the advantages of an instrument cluster with a high resolution colour display. With various information profiles, you can decide which specific data are displayed in the instrument cluster in addition to the usual gauges such as the rev counter, speedometer and odometer.

You can select this information profile quickly and easily using the optional multifunctional steering wheel: depending on your precise needs, you can access detailed Driving Data, for example, or show a visual display of your driver assistance systems. This means the display area can be even better used, because you can also show additional data within the dials.

In the Discover Navigation Infotainment system, you can decide whether you would like to see the navigation map in the Digital Cockpit Pro, or have the classic view on the system display. With Discover Navigation Pro, both display options are available simultaneously.',

    title: Driver Alert System benefits
---

Why do we need this?
====================

Did you know that overtired drivers cause up to 25 per cent of all accidents on motorways? These accidents tend to be particularly serious because the sleepy driver has no chance to react and take avoiding action. So giving drivers early warning they need to take a break is vital for safer travel.

How does the system work?
-------------------------

It monitors driver behaviour closely – noting any erratic steering wheel movements and lane deviations, for example - so it can judge the moment that you are starting to feel sleepy and need to stop. It also continually evaluates traffic signals on the road when you are driving at speeds of more than 40mph. and works out when it‘s time to take a break.

How does it warn the driver?
----------------------------

If the system detects that you’re starting to lose concentration it will alert you with a visual display on the dashboard and a warning sound. If you haven’t taken a break within 15 minutes, the system will repeat the warning.

So it’s always up to you to plan rest breaks into your journeys, of course, but you’ll find our new Driver Alert System a helpful aid to safer driving.',

Keyless Entry
=============

Keyless Entry is our automatic locking and starting system. It’s very convenient as you just have to carry the key, which houses an ID sender.

The key is identified via sensors in the door handles and a radio pulse generator in the key housing when you are within 1.50 metres of your car. It automatically unlocks as soon as the door handle (or boot lid) is operated. The system also releases the steering lock and turns on the ignition electronically, without inserting the key. Provided you have the key on you while inside the car, the engine can be started by simply pressing the starter button. However, the key can also be used like a conventional one to operate the central locking and start the car via the ignition. When leaving the car, you simply press the locking button on the door handles.',

Comfort Seats with Memory Function
==================================

The optional comfort seats with memory function offer an upper backrest adjustment function that makes it possible to angle the top third of the backrest, thus providing better support for the shoulders. Despite additional assemblies in the upper backrest, it has been possible to further increase rear knee room, thanks to the seats’ slim design. The seats still have a lumbar support that can be adjusted in four directions, a memory function for both front seats, electrically adjustable head restraints, and electric belt height adjusters. In addition to being adjustable in eight directions, like standard seats, comfort seats also have electric fore/aft, height, inclination and backrest angle adjustment for an even better fit. Switches for adjusting the seats are easily accessible on the side trim and can be operated intuitively.',

Rain Sensor
===========

Our rain sensors mean you won’t have to keep switching your wipers on and off, or adjusting their speed, according to how hard it is raining. This clever system uses an LED sensor, fitted behind your internal mirror, to detect the amount of rain falling on your windscreen and adjusts the wiper accordingly.

You can also choose different settings, depending on how sensitive you want the rain sensor to be. If you choose the most sensitive setting the wipers will clean off just a few spots of rain, whilst the least sensitive setting will wait a little longer before starting to work. And you don‘t even have to worry about reversing. When the sensor is on and you select reverse gear, the rear wipers will automatically wipe away any rain.

The sensor system consists of a number of infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and a central photodiode. The light emitted by the LEDs is reflected by the windscreen onto the photo sensor. The more drops of water there are on the windscreen, the less light the sensor receives. This information is passed to an electronic control unit, which adapts the wipe intervals of the windscreen wiper accordingly.

And the design means that dirt, minor defects and ageing of the windscreen do not impair its efficiency. You’ll find driving in wet conditions safer and more comfortable because the rain sensor does the hard work, leaving you to concentrate fully on the road. It’s especially useful in situations when your visibility is suddenly impaired - while overtaking lorries on a wet road, for example.',

Isofix child seat fixings
=========================

Isofix is being adopted worldwide as a safer way to travel with your children. The Isofix child seat fixes directly into compatible fittings in your Volkswagen, creating a secure link. It’s quick, simple and there’s no need to use the adult seatbelts.

Studies have shown many child car seats are not fitted properly, putting your children at risk. With Isofix, securing your child’s car seat properly is much easier, reducing the risk of injury in an accident.

Why do we use Isofix?
---------------------

Car manufacturers wanted to create the best, uniform standard for fitting child seats safely, and they came up with Isofix. Isofix child seats can be used in all cars which have compatible factory-fitted fixings. The child seat preparation has two mountings fixed to the body of the car. The compatible child seat fits securely to these mountings by two support arms. They are easy to fit and offer high levels of safety because they are fixed rigidly to the car body. All our cars have Isofix fittings in the back seats.',

Misfuel Prevention device
=========================

Fitted on the filler neck of the Diesel fuel tank, the Misfuel Prevention Device has a mechanically locking flap that prevents a non-Diesel fuel nozzle from being inserted. So it ensures you always get it right and stops you from filling up with the wrong type of fuel.',

Home Safe Lights
================

When you get out of your car, various lights, including the dipped-beam headlights, courtesy lights in the exterior mirrors, rear lights and number-plate lighting, all stay on for a short while before they are switched off automatically. The same lights are switched on when you unlock your car with the remote control. In this way your car’s lights help to illuminate the way to and from your front door, whenever you arrive or set off in the dark. Note the functioning described does differ between models, please refer to the model pricelists for specific details.',

Parking Sensors
===============

If you drive a lot in towns and cities you’ll often find yourself having to manoeuvre your car into some tight parking spots. The result can often be minor damage. Our parking sensors make your job easier by warning when you’re getting too close to something, preventing small knocks and scratches.

The system has up to six ultrasonic sensors located in the rear - and sometimes the front - bumpers. Compact, and painted in the body colour, they blend in well and are barely visible. The sensors monitor a range of up to 150 centimetres behind and, depending on the model, in front of the vehicle. The system swings into action when you engage reverse gear, or at very low speed.

It uses the principle of the echo sounder to detect obstacles and their distance from your car. If it senses you are too close it starts to sound an intermittent warning tone which gets faster the nearer you are. Get so close that a collision is imminent and the warning signal becomes continuous. If your car has a radio or radio navigation display this gives you extra help by showing exactly how close any obstacles are.',

Side Scan
=========

When you indicate that you’re about to change lanes, our Side Scan assistant warns you about approaching traffic.

If there are cars behind you or in your blind spot, LED lights will flash in your wing mirrors to alert you.

The system is designed to alert you only when necessary: stationary objects or oncoming vehicles don’t trigger warnings.',

Service Plan
============

For cars under 1 year old that haven’t yet had their first service.

A Volkswagen Service Plan covers the first two consecutive services with an option to pay upfront or spread over 24 monthly payments.

If your car is under 1 year old and you want to have all your general maintenance work and tyre cover included as well, [consider a Fixed Cost Maintenance plan.](https://www.volkswagen.co.uk/en/owners-and-drivers/servicing/service-plans/buy-a-service-plan/fixed-cost-maintenance.html)',

Proactive occupant protection – Front is standard / Rear is optional and is included with the addition of Emergency assist or Side Assist Plus options
======================================================================================================================================================

Proactive occupant protection system. For the first time, the PreCrash sensors are not only able to react to car handling processes (for instance, as registered via ESC) and acute collision hazards from the front (detected via Front Assist), but also to hazards from the rear. The PreCrash system uses sensors of the Side Assist lane change assistant. The system uses radar sensors to continuously monitor the positions and speeds of the cars behind the Arteon. The proactive rear occupant protection system evaluates this data. It does this not only while the vehicle is in motion, but also when it is stationary (with the motor running or in start-stop mode); such as when waiting at a red light. When another vehicle approaches the new gran turismo, the system calculates the probability of a collision using data on the positions and speeds of both cars. If there is an imminent danger of a collision, the PreCrash assistance system reacts in the blink of an eye. The hazard warning lights activate immediately; at the same time all windows are closed to just a small gap (for optimal bolstering of the side airbags) as is the sunroof. While this is happening, the belt tensioners tighten the front seatbelts. Last but not least, the optional electrically adjustable front seats are aligned. The belts, head restraints and airbags are now able to provide maximum protection.

Side Assist Plus
----------------

The brand new Side Assist Plus feature comes with rear traffic alert. Radar-sensors control the warning system for changing lanes and blind spot, when you’re driving at 6mph or above.

The system notices fast-approaching vehicles in adjacent lanes, and provides a visual warning through a light placed in the wing mirror.',

Mobile Online Services
======================

From navigation and safety to entertainment and personalisation, Mobile Online Services gives you access to a huge variety of features.

Standard Features
-----------------

Features such as Emergency Call Service and eCall Emergency System come as standard with Mobile Online Services.

VW Connect
----------

VW Connect opens up Volkswagen’s digital services to you and makes you Volkswagen connected. Following a one-off activation, you can use VW Connect’s features free of charge. All you have to do is sign up to VW Connect online via Volkswagen.

VW Connect Plus
---------------

For even more convenience and entertainment, with your Volkswagen ID and “VW Connect Plus” activation, you have access to extra smart functions: from smart navigation with real-time information and media streaming and Internet radio to using your smartphone as a remote control.

Usage of these services requires you to sign up online to a separate VW Connect Plus contract with Volkswagen AG.

You can view all VW Connect and VW Connect Plus services at a glance here: [www.volkswagen.co.uk/en/connected-services.html](https://www.volkswagen.co.uk/en/connected-services.html)',

Mobile Online Services (ID.Models Only)
=======================================

The eCall emergency system is available immediately. And with the MobileOnline services, you can bring digital assistants on board, get the latest information on charging and traffic and remotely control selected functions from your smartphone.

Use Mobile Online Services to control the following features directly from your phone:

Air conditioning
----------------

You can set your preferred temperature in your ID. using the Volkswagen app. You can start and stop your air conditioning system when your ID. is online or set your preferred temperature for your desired departure time using your smartphone. For the ultimate in convenience: you can even adjust seat heating before you drive.

Navigation
----------

Find out traffic information and trust in the best possible route.

*   Online Traffic Information: Your navigation system accesses Online Traffic Information, detects accidents, roadworks and other traffic issues and recommends the ideal route, practically in real time.
*   Online Route Calculation: Your ID. Online Route Calculation allows your ID. to take traffic predictions and current traffic conditions along the route into consideration from the start and predictively calculate the optimum route.
*   Parking Spaces: Depending on the car parks which support the process, the Parking Spaces service quickly tells you where the nearest car park with available spaces is located and can send the destination to your vehicle’s navigation system. Prices, capacities, available parking spaces and opening times are also displayed.
*   Charging Stations: When your ID. reaches reserve battery level, the app – if desired – automatically searches for charging stations nearby and displays prices, opening times, availability and connector type. The selected station can then be included in route navigation.
*   Online Map Update: Your navigation maps are always automatically up to date in ID. family models if you so choose. The infotainment system updates and installs map material in your vehicle at regular intervals when it is online.

Online voice control
--------------------

By saying “Hello ID.”, you can control a number of infotainment and vehicle functions such as telephone, radio navigation automatic air conditioner using your voice. Thanks to Online Voice Control, you can select your destination and favourite song almost as intuitively as if you were talking to a passenger sitting next to you.

Entertainment
-------------

Listen to live radio stations or podcasts via Internet Radio and enjoy all the freedoms of a Wi-Fi hotspot for up to eight mobile devices. The data volume required for this can be supplied from your smartphone via tethering or conveniently via a paid contract with the external mobile communications partner Cubic Telecom.

We Charge
=========

E-mobility can be simple and fun – after all, you should be able to get anywhere with ease. Simply open the Volkswagen.app and check the location of the nearest charging station – and you can charge your vehicle and collect special prices with your Volkswagen ID.

We Charge in the Volkswagen app.
--------------------------------

We Charge functions are integrated into the Volkswagen app. Use the app to search and find public charging stations and check their availability in real time. You can view all your charging sessions for full cost transparency. Control of your charging card and plans is just a tap away.

We Charge in-car app
--------------------

With Over-the-Air Update, it’s easy to connect your We Charge app to your navigation system. You can filter charging stations by capacity and availability in We Charge view and start route guidance without leaving the navigation app. That way, you can stay connected any time and find charging stations anywhere.

Electric Vehicle Route Planner
------------------------------

With our route planner, you can find many charging stations and add them to your route planning as a destination or stopover. Journeys can be planned along the public charging network, taking into account individual settings such as battery level along the route. Visit [https://www.volkswagen.co.uk/en/electric-and-hybrid/living-electric/lifestyle/ev-route-planner.html](https://www.volkswagen.co.uk/en/electric-and-hybrid/charging-and-range/electric-vehicle-route-planner.html) to start routing.

For more information on our We Charge plans, please visit [www.volkswagen.co.uk/en/electric-and-hybrid/charging-and-range/we-charge.html](https://www.volkswagen.co.uk/en/electric-and-hybrid/charging-and-range/charging/we-charge.html)

Upgrade
=======

Upgrades allow you to make your Volkswagen even more connected. Simply using your car’s infotainment system or the Volkswagen Connect shop, you can instantly purchase navigation upgrades, driver assist systems, and more. You can view the Upgradesavailable for your vehicle below as a Mobile Online Services primary user and conveniently purchase them directly online.

Upgrades for Connect ready vehicless
------------------------------------

*   Navigation: Add navigation functions for your Ready 2 Discover infotainment system and enhance your vehicle with intuitive navigation. Activating these functions allows you to access integrated, intuitive navigation with a 2D map display for Europe and points of interest (POIs). Once activated in the vehicle, these functions are permanently available to you and do not require an Internet connection or a We Connect contract. As well as these handy offline functions, you can access additional useful online services with the We Connect Plus licence. The Online Traffic Information service keeps you, the primary user, informed of changes and hazards along your route almost in real time, while the Online Route Calculation service provides optimal and forward-looking route guidance. Online Map Update automatically updates your map material at regular intervals when your vehicle is online, when you select the ‘Share my position’ setting in your infotainment system.
*   Voice Control: By saying “Hello Volkswagen”, you enter into a natural dialogue – for safe and convenient control of selected telephony, media or navigation functions. Activate voice control for your infotainment system Ready 2 Discover or Discover Media and control numerous vehicle functions using your voice. After all, depending on the vehicle model and equipment, many selected functions can be controlled using your voice. This allows you to focus completely on the road and enjoy driving even more.
*   App Connect: With App-Connect, selected apps and content are transmitted directly to the display of the infotainment system in your Volkswagen and can be comfortably and clearly controlled within your line of vision. That makes it incredibly easy to access music, news, maps or audiobooks, for example. Volkswagen offers three interfaces for connecting smartphones, with numerous options: Apple CarPlay™, Android Auto™ by Google and MirrorLink®. Wireless use of Apple CarPlay™ and Android Auto™ by Google is also available as a We Upgrade function for the Discover Media navigation system and Ready 2 Discover. To avoid distraction, only certified apps can be started during the journey.

More We Upgrade functions for your Golf
---------------------------------------

*   Adaptive Cruise Control ACC: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) keeps to a constant pre-set speed of your choice, up to 130 mph. When your Golf approaches another vehicle in front, ACC adapts the speed automatically, keeping your pre-set distance from the other vehicle (within the system’s limits).
*   Light Assist: With the Light Assist main beam control system, you’ll see driving at night in your Golf in a whole new light. Light Assist uses a camera installed behind the windscreen to detect oncoming traffic or vehicles driving ahead and automatically switch between dipped and main beam (within the system’s limits).
*   Dynamic Road Sign Display: Dynamic Road Sign Display can detect speed limits, overtaking bans and hazard signs on camera (within system limitations) and show this on the multi-function display. So it’s easier to keep track of what''s going on in traffic.
*   Mood Lighting: The expansion of the basic ambient lighting enables the interior to be lit according to mood, thanks to the individual choice of colour. Mood Lighting offers an expanded range of colours and a wider selection for creating lighting accents as a We Upgrade function. Whether you prefer cooler or warmer lighting, you’re in the bright lights of the big city or on a dark country road: on every trip, you can create a different atmosphere to suit you and your passengers.

For more information on which We Upgrade functions are available for your vehicle and current offer prices, please visit [www.volkswagen.co.uk/en/connected-services/we-connect/we-upgrade.html#we-upgrade-functions](https://www.volkswagen.co.uk/en/connected-services/we-connect/we-upgrade.html#we-upgrade-functions)',

ID. Heat Pump
=============

Volkswagen heat pump technology is more efficient than traditional electric heaters because it requires less energy to produce the same amount of heat. Additionally, by using waste heat from various sources, it reduces the drain on the vehicle’s battery, which significantly increases range. Overall, the technology minimises energy consumption, making our ID. Range even more environmentally friendly.

ID. Emergency Assist
====================

If it does not succeed, it can bring the vehicle to a controlled stop within the system limits and can thus possibly prevent an accident. (within the limits of the system).',

ID. Area View
=============

Manoeuvring in the busy city centre, in a multi-storey car park or in rough terrain: there are many situations in which drivers could use a few extra eyes. With the optional Area View you get them in the form of four cameras that capture the area around the vehicle and transfer helpful information to the screen of the infotainment system. For example, you can see kerbs or parking markings better and even look around the corner.',

ID. Keyless Entry
=================

Keyless access offers you convenient and secure access to your car. The system has two components: the transmitter and the starter module. You just carry the transmitter - the starter module is built into the dashboard. Within a radius of 1.5 metres around the car rolling codes are exchanged between the key and the car and the transmitter switches the system to ''Open''. By the time you''re behind the wheel the steering lock has been released and the electrical system activated. If the key has been left inside the car by mistake, the system will refuse to lock it.',

Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
=============================

Adaptive Cruise Control ACC helps you to maintain a previously set speed and preset minimum distance to the vehicle in front. It also has predictive cruise control and cornering assistance. This means that ACC can adapt the vehicle’s speed to the relevant speed.',

Park Assist
===========

Park Assist not only tells you whether a parking space is large enough when driving past – it can also drive into it for you. You operate the clutch, accelerator and brake. And it does the rest.

*   Sensors scan suitable parking spaces (up to max. 40 km/h)
*   Parallel parking spaces must have one vehicle length plus 80 cm manoeuvring distance for driving into the space, and at least 25 cm in front of and behind the vehicle for driving out of a parking space
*   Parking bays must have at least 35 cm clearance on both sides',

Air Care Climatronic
====================

The 3-zone Pure Air Climatronic automatically ensures clean air and healthy air conditioning in the interior of the vehicle. An air quality sensor and an anti-allergenic filter keep the air quality at a constantly high level and prevent the intrusion of harmful substances, including fungal spores and allergens. Using the 3-zone climate control and the selectable climate profiles, all the passengers can choose their own individual feel-good climate settings. The Gentle climate profile is specifically designed to meet the needs of sensitive people and small children. Thanks to sun and humidity sensors, the optimum air conditioning and healthy air humidity is achieved, depending on the intensity and direction of the direct sunlight. This means that misted windows are also a thing of the past.',

ID. Park Assist Plus with memory function
=========================================

Now you can teach your car to perform recurring parking manoeuvres. The memory function for the Park Assist Plus is capable of saving up to 5 unique parking manoeuvres and can then repeat them independently under your supervision.

If you choose the Park Assist Plus with the memory function, your car is capable of identifying parallel parking spaces at a speed of up to 24 mph and parking bays at a speed of up to 12 mph. In addition, you can teach your car up to five individual parking manoeuvres. The memory function records parking manoeuvres at speeds below 24 mph with a distance of up to 50 metres. For example, when you park your car in a carport or a garage. You only have to park your Volkswagen once yourself and then save the parking manoeuvre. Afterwards, your car is capable of repeating the parking manoeuvre on its own. You only have to supervise the parking manoeuvre and intervene if necessary.',

Dynamic Chassis Control (DCC) Allows individual tuning of shock absorption and other driving mode characteristics
=================================================================================================================

Choice of four preset modes: Eco, Normal, Comfort and Sport, as well as an Individual mode that allows up to 43 selectable stages.

For the first time the controlled shock absorbers can be almost infinitely adjusted across an expanded range from the individual settings submenu (Comfort+ to Sport+). Beyond the familiar ''Comfort'' setting, the driver can increase ride comfort even further by moving the control slider to the left (Comfort+); a setting that is sportier than the familiar ''Sport'' setting can be set by moving the slider to the right (Sport+). The driver can make adjustments between the Comfort, Normal and Sport profiles. Thus, the driver has the ability to choose a truly personalised setting.',

    title: How Dynamic Light Assist works
---

Dynamic Light Assist
====================

Dynamic Light Assist improves visibility at night. The system can detect oncoming vehicles and vehicles ahead and automatically masks the corresponding areas of your main beam headlights.

In built-up areas, the vehicle also switches automatically from main beam to dipped beam. For you this means that you can drive for longer and more often with the main beam on. Streets are thus better illuminated and obstacles can be detected earlier.',

Trailer Assist
==============

Trailer Assist takes care of the steering whilst you are manoeuvering with a trailer. Your car will steer automatically while you just need to take care of changing gear, accelerating and braking. This means you remain in control at all times.',

Dynamic Chassis Control Pro (DCC Pro)
=====================================

Whether you enjoy a sporty or a comfortable driving style, the optional dynamic chassis control DCC Pro, available as a option from Life, offers you the possibility to adapt the running gear to suit your needs. The electronically controlled shock absorbers with innovative two-valve technology react in milliseconds to the road conditions and the driving situation and automatically adapt the damping behaviour. The two-valve technology enables extremely precise adjustment to ensure a high degree of comfort and dynamics. With DCC Pro, you can choose from different driving profiles such as comfort, sport or individual. Individual mode allows you to set your preferences using the slider. The vehicle dynamics settings contained in the driving profile selection further enhance vehicle handling and therefore ensure greater driving pleasure and precision.',
