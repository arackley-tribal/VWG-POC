The unique driving experience of EVs can be particularly appealing, especially in urban environments.\n\nUltimately, \"fun to drive\" is subjective, and I encourage you to try an electric vehicle, like the ID.3 or ID.4, to see how it feels for yourself!

While it's true that the production of batteries for BEVs does have environmental impacts, studies often assess the overall lifecycle emissions, including production, use, and disposal.\n\nIt's important to consider the entire lifecycle of vehicles. While battery production can be resource-intensive, BEVs typically produce significantly lower emissions during their operational phase, particularly when charged from renewable energy sources. Over time, the total emissions from BEVs can be lower compared to internal combustion engine vehicles when considering factors such as fuel consumption and emissions during use.\n\nVolkswagen is committed to improving the sustainability of its battery production and supply chains to lessen environmental impacts. Ongoing research and innovation are significant in this transition.\n\nIf you have more specific inquiries or would like to discuss further, I'm here to help!",

While it's true that if the electricity used to charge a BEV comes from fossil fuels, it can reduce the overall environmental benefits, several key factors can mitigate this impact:\n\n1. **Efficiency**: BEVs are generally more energy-efficient than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. They convert a higher percentage of energy from the grid to power at the wheels, resulting in lower overall emissions, even when charged with fossil fuel-generated electricity.\n\n2. **Long-term Transition**: The global energy landscape is shifting towards greater use of renewable energy sources. As more countries invest in solar, wind, and other renewables, the grid becomes cleaner, which means that the carbon footprint of charging EVs will continue to decrease over time.\n\n3. **Environmental Benefits Over Lifecycle**: Studies show that over their entire life cycle, including production, operation, and disposal, BEVs often result in lower total emissions compared to traditional vehicles, especially as battery recycling processes are improved.\n\n4. **Local Improvement**: Charging BEVs in locations with a higher proportion of renewable energy in the mix can maximize their environmental benefits.\n\nWhile challenges remain, the transition to electric mobility, alongside the growth of renewable energy, represents a significant step towards reducing the overall carbon footprint of personal transportation.

But the last 20% takes longer to complete as capacity reduces, so charging to 100% can cause unnecessary delays. In the coming years we can expect that these times will be significantly reduced too.

As long as \nyour electric car and the charging station meet strict legal standards, no electricity will \nflow until a secure and fully safe contact has been established. You can also safely take \nyour car through a car wash and open the bonnet in the rain. And your electric car is as \nsafe as any other when there is lightning.\n\n\nLike any Volkswagen car, it’s designed to the same Volkswagen build quality and \nreliability we’re known and loved for.

While there have been high-profile cases of EV fires, they are relatively rare when considering the overall number of EVs on the road.\n\n2. **Causes**: Fires in EVs can occur due to battery issues, such as damage or manufacturing defects, whereas ICE vehicles may be more prone to fires from fuel leaks, overheating, or electrical failures.\n\n3. **Safety Features**: EVs are designed with specific safety features to manage battery risks, including thermal management systems and structural protections to minimize potential hazards.\n\n4. **Regulatory Standards**: Both EVs and ICE vehicles are subject to strict safety regulations. Manufacturers continuously work to improve safety technology to mitigate risks.\n\nWhile both types of vehicles carry some risk of fire, ongoing advancements in technology and safety practices aim to reduce these risks further.

The party typically advocates for free market policies, a smaller role for government in the economy, individual entrepreneurship, and a focus on traditional values. It tends to support policies that promote economic growth, private enterprise, and reducing public spending.\n\n2. **Labour Party**: The Labour Party is associated with centre-left political ideologies and was founded to represent the interests of the working class. The party typically advocates for social justice, workers' rights, and public services. Labour often supports higher taxation on the wealthy to fund public services, investments in social infrastructure, and policies aimed at reducing inequality.\n\nBoth parties have distinct policies, goals, and voter bases, and they play significant roles in shaping UK politics. If you have more specific questions about either party or their policies, feel free to ask!",

They often prioritize economic growth, entrepreneurship, and traditional social values.\n   - **Labour Party**: Positioned centre-left, the Labour Party emphasizes social justice, workers' rights, and a strong welfare state. They advocate for greater government involvement in the economy to address inequality and provide public services.\n\n2. **Economic Policies**:\n   - **Conservatives**: Tend to support tax reductions, deregulation, and measures that encourage private enterprise. They advocate for austerity measures during economic downturns.\n   - **Labour**: Generally supports higher taxes on the wealthy and large corporations to fund public services. They advocate for investment in infrastructure, education, and healthcare.\n\n3. **Social Policies**:\n   - **Conservatives**: Often promote traditional values and may take a more cautious approach to social change. They may emphasize law and order and a strong national defense.\n   - **Labour**: Typically prioritizes equality and inclusivity, advocating for rights related to gender, race, and LGBTQ+ issues. They usually push for reforms aimed at enhancing social welfare.\n\n4. **Voter Base**:\n   - **Conservatives**: Tend to attract voters from middle and upper-income groups, business owners, and those in rural areas.\n   - **Labour**: Generally draws support from working-class individuals, trade unions, and urban populations.\n\nOverall, the Conservative and Labour Parties represent different visions for the UK's governance and social structure, reflected in their policies and political strategies.

Unlike traditional heaters that draw directly from the battery, a heat pump uses waste heat from the traction battery and other high-voltage components to warm the interior. This efficiency reduces the overall load on the battery, allowing for greater range. By decreasing the energy required for heating, the heat pump effectively maximises the vehicle's driving distance on a single charge.",

These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery.

Unlike traditional heaters that draw directly from the battery, heat pumps utilise waste heat from the traction battery and other high-voltage components to warm the interior, thereby reducing the load on the battery. This means less energy is consumed for heating, which can positively affect overall driving range, especially in colder conditions.

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%.

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery.

These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery.

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

This means that the emissions produced during its manufacturing are offset through various initiatives, such as emission reduction strategies. While driving, the ID.3 produces zero CO2 emissions, contributing to cleaner air quality. However, it's essential to consider that the overall CO2 footprint also depends on how the electricity used for charging is generated. For more comprehensive insights into the vehicle's environmental impact, including lifecycle assessments, I recommend checking Volkswagen's sustainability reports or related resources.",

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

However, the amount of energy lost is generally minimal, especially if the car is parked and not connected to a charging source for a short period. To help maintain battery health, it's advisable to keep the charge level between 20-80% and avoid leaving the vehicle completely discharged for extended periods.",

A \nlarger battery capacity means the electric vehicle can hold more energy; a higher kWh battery \nmeans a longer driving range before the need for recharging. \nSimilar to the size of a fuel tank \nkW (Kilowatt)Refers to the electric motors maximum output. Higher the kW figure the more power an EV can \ndeliver. In the case of a charger, it represents the rate of power from the charger to the EV \nbattery, indicating how quickly the charger van charge the car\nPower Output of an engine e.g. PS\nMiles per kWhHow far an electric car can go using one kWh of electricity. The higher the number the more \nefficient the car.  \nSimilar to MPG \nAC (Alternating Current)A charge of electricity that regularly changes direction. \nAn EV battery requires DC therefore, to store energy from alternating current, the EV’s onboard \ncharger must convert it first, which leads to longer charging times. This is the recommended way \nof regularly charging your EV, as it can be done overnight at home.\nn/a\nDC (Direct Current)Electric charge that flows in one direction. \nDC charging is faster than AC charging as when using direct current, energy can be stored in the \nbattery without being converted which makes the process more efficient and saves time. Great \nfor when you need to charge quickly on the go.\nn/a\nCharging connectors\nCCS and CHAdeMO\nTwo types of EV charging connectors.  CCS (Combined charging system) connectors allow both AC \nand DC charging from the same port, whilst CHAdeMO requires a separate connector for AC \ncharging. All Enyaq’s come with a CCS charging port.\nn/a\nPre-conditioning There are two different types of Pre- conditioning, 1) Cabin pre-conditioning which refers to the \nability to remotely pre-heat or cool your car before you get in, preferably whilst charging, as this \nwill maximise your range as less energy will be needed to heat or cool your car whilst travelling. 2) \nBattery pre-conditioning is where battery is warmed to the optimal temperature before charging, \nto help improve charging speed\nn/a\nRecuperation The mechanism that captures and stores energy typically released during braking and coasting. \nElectric vehicles can have various recuperation modes and the strength of the braking energy \nrecovery can be adjusted by the driver. The stronger the recuperation level the more energy \nharvested which in turn maximises range.\nn/a\nTethered chargerA tethered charger is when the charging cable is linked to the charger. Tethered Home chargers \ncan be more convenient as you won't need to constantly retrieve a separate cable from your car \nor home.\nn/a",

They typically have reduced servicing requirements due to fewer moving parts and may come with taxation benefits, such as exemptions from road tax.

Public charging infrastructure has improved significantly, and you'll find rapid chargers (starting from 23 kW) and ultra-rapid chargers (from 100 kW) at major routes, similar to petrol stations. All electric vehicles, including Volkswagen ID models, have a maximum charging speed, so it's good to consider this when planning your stops. Be sure to locate charging stations in advance to ensure a smooth journey. For more detailed guidance on charging, you can visit the Volkswagen UK site.",

These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery.

          "content": "A heat pump in the context of electric vehicles, like the Volkswagen ID range, is a technology that helps improve the efficiency of heating and cooling within the car. It works by transferring heat from the outside air to the inside of the vehicle and vice versa. This means that in winter, the heat pump can extract warmth from the outside air and use it to heat the cabin, while in summer, it can help cool the interior by removing heat. This system is more energy-efficient than traditional resistance heating, which helps to conserve battery power and extend the driving range of the vehicle. If you'd like to know more about the benefits or specifics of heat pump technology in our electric vehicles, feel free to ask!",

Longer journeys are fine too, 280 - 435 miles is the range our IDs are now hitting.![Close-up of person charging their ID.3](https://assets.volkswagen.com/is/image/volkswagenag/electric_cars-the_new_id3_2023-IN0272_ID3_exterior_charging_plug-16x9-1920x1152?Zml0PWNyb3AsMSZmbXQ9anBnJnFsdD03OSZ3aWQ9ODAwJmhlaT00ODAmYWxpZ249MC4wMCwwLjAwJmJmYz1vZmYmZGI2OQ==)Charging optionsYou can charge your Volkswagen electric vehicle with a 3-pin plug. This is the slowest method but basically means you can charge anywhere there’s electricity. What we recommend is that you install an Ohme wallbox, which allows you to fully charge quicker and easier. Since December 2022 the public charging network has grown by 45%. Zapmap",

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

Once you’ve got used to that routine, you’ll be less focused on your battery level and be able to enjoy worry-free journeys with shorter stops.![Kate Jeffereys with an ID.Buzz](https://assets.volkswagen.com/is/image/volkswagenag/Kate-with-ID.Buzz(1)1920x1080?Zml0PWNyb3AsMSZmbXQ9anBnJnFsdD03OSZ3aWQ9ODAwJmhlaT00NTAmYWxpZ249MC4wMCwwLjAwJmJmYz1vZmYmNjYwMA==)![ID.7 overlooking a",

Sound, the sound of the ID.7 models from Volkswagen when driving at a slow speed. To make road traffic safer, your ID.7 Tourer is quieter on the inside up to a speed of 20mph and can be heard a little more clearly outside. The artificially generated vehicle noise makes the almost noiseless electric drives audible for pedestrians and cyclists. It sounds when the vehicle is moving off, when reversing and at speeds of up to 20mph. At higher speeds, the rolling noise of the tyres is sufficiently loud that an additional acoustic signal is no longer necessary.Need helpCareersInfo for emergency respondersContact UsNewsLoginTechnologyConnected servicesPrivacyCompliance and IntegrityLegalFAQsFind a retailerManage cookiesID.

Unlike traditional internal combustion engine vehicles that rely on petrol or diesel, EVs produce no tailpipe emissions, making them a more environmentally friendly option. They offer various benefits, including lower running costs and reduced reliance on fossil fuels, which aligns with sustainable driving practices. The Volkswagen ID range includes several innovative electric models designed for efficiency and performance. If you're interested in learning more or experiencing an EV, I encourage taking a test drive.",

A \nlarger battery capacity means the electric vehicle can hold more energy; a higher kWh battery \nmeans a longer driving range before the need for recharging. \nSimilar to the size of a fuel tank \nkW (Kilowatt)Refers to the electric motors maximum output. Higher the kW figure the more power an EV can \ndeliver. In the case of a charger, it represents the rate of power from the charger to the EV \nbattery, indicating how quickly the charger van charge the car\nPower Output of an engine e.g. PS\nMiles per kWhHow far an electric car can go using one kWh of electricity. The higher the number the more \nefficient the car.  \nSimilar to MPG \nAC (Alternating Current)A charge of electricity that regularly changes direction. \nAn EV battery requires DC therefore, to store energy from alternating current, the EV’s onboard \ncharger must convert it first, which leads to longer charging times. This is the recommended way \nof regularly charging your EV, as it can be done overnight at home.\nn/a\nDC (Direct Current)Electric charge that flows in one direction. \nDC charging is faster than AC charging as when using direct current, energy can be stored in the \nbattery without being converted which makes the process more efficient and saves time. Great \nfor when you need to charge quickly on the go.\nn/a\nCharging connectors\nCCS and CHAdeMO\nTwo types of EV charging connectors.  CCS (Combined charging system) connectors allow both AC \nand DC charging from the same port, whilst CHAdeMO requires a separate connector for AC \ncharging. All Enyaq’s come with a CCS charging port.\nn/a\nPre-conditioning There are two different types of Pre- conditioning, 1) Cabin pre-conditioning which refers to the \nability to remotely pre-heat or cool your car before you get in, preferably whilst charging, as this \nwill maximise your range as less energy will be needed to heat or cool your car whilst travelling. 2) \nBattery pre-conditioning is where battery is warmed to the optimal temperature before charging, \nto help improve charging speed\nn/a\nRecuperation The mechanism that captures and stores energy typically released during braking and coasting. \nElectric vehicles can have various recuperation modes and the strength of the braking energy \nrecovery can be adjusted by the driver. The stronger the recuperation level the more energy \nharvested which in turn maximises range.\nn/a\nTethered chargerA tethered charger is when the charging cable is linked to the charger. Tethered Home chargers \ncan be more convenient as you won't need to constantly retrieve a separate cable from your car \nor home.\nn/a",

A \nlarger battery capacity means the electric vehicle can hold more energy; a higher kWh battery \nmeans a longer driving range before the need for recharging. \nSimilar to the size of a fuel tank \nkW (Kilowatt)Refers to the electric motors maximum output. Higher the kW figure the more power an EV can \ndeliver. In the case of a charger, it represents the rate of power from the charger to the EV \nbattery, indicating how quickly the charger van charge the car\nPower Output of an engine e.g. PS\nMiles per kWhHow far an electric car can go using one kWh of electricity. The higher the number the more \nefficient the car.  \nSimilar to MPG \nAC (Alternating Current)A charge of electricity that regularly changes direction. \nAn EV battery requires DC therefore, to store energy from alternating current, the EV’s onboard \ncharger must convert it first, which leads to longer charging times. This is the recommended way \nof regularly charging your EV, as it can be done overnight at home.\nn/a\nDC (Direct Current)Electric charge that flows in one direction. \nDC charging is faster than AC charging as when using direct current, energy can be stored in the \nbattery without being converted which makes the process more efficient and saves time. Great \nfor when you need to charge quickly on the go.\nn/a\nCharging connectors\nCCS and CHAdeMO\nTwo types of EV charging connectors.  CCS (Combined charging system) connectors allow both AC \nand DC charging from the same port, whilst CHAdeMO requires a separate connector for AC \ncharging. All Enyaq’s come with a CCS charging port.\nn/a\nPre-conditioning There are two different types of Pre- conditioning, 1) Cabin pre-conditioning which refers to the \nability to remotely pre-heat or cool your car before you get in, preferably whilst charging, as this \nwill maximise your range as less energy will be needed to heat or cool your car whilst travelling. 2) \nBattery pre-conditioning is where battery is warmed to the optimal temperature before charging, \nto help improve charging speed\nn/a\nRecuperation The mechanism that captures and stores energy typically released during braking and coasting. \nElectric vehicles can have various recuperation modes and the strength of the braking energy \nrecovery can be adjusted by the driver. The stronger the recuperation level the more energy \nharvested which in turn maximises range.\nn/a\nTethered chargerA tethered charger is when the charging cable is linked to the charger. Tethered Home chargers \ncan be more convenient as you won't need to constantly retrieve a separate cable from your car \nor home.\nn/a",

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

A \nlarger battery capacity means the electric vehicle can hold more energy; a higher kWh battery \nmeans a longer driving range before the need for recharging. \nSimilar to the size of a fuel tank \nkW (Kilowatt)Refers to the electric motors maximum output. Higher the kW figure the more power an EV can \ndeliver. In the case of a charger, it represents the rate of power from the charger to the EV \nbattery, indicating how quickly the charger van charge the car\nPower Output of an engine e.g. PS\nMiles per kWhHow far an electric car can go using one kWh of electricity. The higher the number the more \nefficient the car.  \nSimilar to MPG \nAC (Alternating Current)A charge of electricity that regularly changes direction. \nAn EV battery requires DC therefore, to store energy from alternating current, the EV’s onboard \ncharger must convert it first, which leads to longer charging times. This is the recommended way \nof regularly charging your EV, as it can be done overnight at home.\nn/a\nDC (Direct Current)Electric charge that flows in one direction. \nDC charging is faster than AC charging as when using direct current, energy can be stored in the \nbattery without being converted which makes the process more efficient and saves time. Great \nfor when you need to charge quickly on the go.\nn/a\nCharging connectors\nCCS and CHAdeMO\nTwo types of EV charging connectors.  CCS (Combined charging system) connectors allow both AC \nand DC charging from the same port, whilst CHAdeMO requires a separate connector for AC \ncharging. All Enyaq’s come with a CCS charging port.\nn/a\nPre-conditioning There are two different types of Pre- conditioning, 1) Cabin pre-conditioning which refers to the \nability to remotely pre-heat or cool your car before you get in, preferably whilst charging, as this \nwill maximise your range as less energy will be needed to heat or cool your car whilst travelling. 2) \nBattery pre-conditioning is where battery is warmed to the optimal temperature before charging, \nto help improve charging speed\nn/a\nRecuperation The mechanism that captures and stores energy typically released during braking and coasting. \nElectric vehicles can have various recuperation modes and the strength of the braking energy \nrecovery can be adjusted by the driver. The stronger the recuperation level the more energy \nharvested which in turn maximises range.\nn/a\nTethered chargerA tethered charger is when the charging cable is linked to the charger. Tethered Home chargers \ncan be more convenient as you won't need to constantly retrieve a separate cable from your car \nor home.\nn/a",

EVs use electric motors and battery packs to drive the vehicle, which results in zero tailpipe emissions while driving. This makes them a more sustainable option compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. EVs can be charged via home chargers or at public charging stations, and they often feature advanced technologies, such as regenerative braking and infotainment systems.",

A \nlarger battery capacity means the electric vehicle can hold more energy; a higher kWh battery \nmeans a longer driving range before the need for recharging. \nSimilar to the size of a fuel tank \nkW (Kilowatt)Refers to the electric motors maximum output. Higher the kW figure the more power an EV can \ndeliver. In the case of a charger, it represents the rate of power from the charger to the EV \nbattery, indicating how quickly the charger van charge the car\nPower Output of an engine e.g. PS\nMiles per kWhHow far an electric car can go using one kWh of electricity. The higher the number the more \nefficient the car.  \nSimilar to MPG \nAC (Alternating Current)A charge of electricity that regularly changes direction. \nAn EV battery requires DC therefore, to store energy from alternating current, the EV’s onboard \ncharger must convert it first, which leads to longer charging times. This is the recommended way \nof regularly charging your EV, as it can be done overnight at home.\nn/a\nDC (Direct Current)Electric charge that flows in one direction. \nDC charging is faster than AC charging as when using direct current, energy can be stored in the \nbattery without being converted which makes the process more efficient and saves time. Great \nfor when you need to charge quickly on the go.\nn/a\nCharging connectors\nCCS and CHAdeMO\nTwo types of EV charging connectors.  CCS (Combined charging system) connectors allow both AC \nand DC charging from the same port, whilst CHAdeMO requires a separate connector for AC \ncharging. All Enyaq’s come with a CCS charging port.\nn/a\nPre-conditioning There are two different types of Pre- conditioning, 1) Cabin pre-conditioning which refers to the \nability to remotely pre-heat or cool your car before you get in, preferably whilst charging, as this \nwill maximise your range as less energy will be needed to heat or cool your car whilst travelling. 2) \nBattery pre-conditioning is where battery is warmed to the optimal temperature before charging, \nto help improve charging speed\nn/a\nRecuperation The mechanism that captures and stores energy typically released during braking and coasting. \nElectric vehicles can have various recuperation modes and the strength of the braking energy \nrecovery can be adjusted by the driver. The stronger the recuperation level the more energy \nharvested which in turn maximises range.\nn/a\nTethered chargerA tethered charger is when the charging cable is linked to the charger. Tethered Home chargers \ncan be more convenient as you won't need to constantly retrieve a separate cable from your car \nor home.\nn/a",

Firstly, they tend to have lower running costs compared to petrol or diesel cars, thanks to reduced fuel expenses and fewer moving parts leading to lower servicing requirements. Secondly, EVs produce significantly lower emissions—often a 50 to 80% better carbon footprint than their petrol counterparts—making them more environmentally friendly. Additionally, charging can often be done at home, providing convenience and less time spent at petrol stations. There's also the potential for government incentives and local benefits, such as exemptions from congestion charges or free parking. Overall, the combination of cost savings, environmental impact, and convenience makes driving electric an appealing choice.",
