It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

It works by transferring heat from the outside air to the inside of the vehicle and vice versa. This means that in winter, the heat pump can extract warmth from the outside air and use it to heat the cabin, while in summer, it can help cool the interior by removing heat. This system is more energy-efficient than traditional resistance heating, which helps to conserve battery power and extend the driving range of the vehicle.

These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

If you use your car, like most drivers, to run errands, for the school run or to drive to work you probably average less than 19.5 miles per day.

Longer journeys are fine too, 280 - 435 miles is the range our IDs are now hitting.![Close-up of person charging their ID.3](https://assets.volkswagen.com/is/image/volkswagenag/electric_cars-the_new_id3_2023-IN0272_ID3_exterior_charging_plug-16x9-1920x1152?Zml0PWNyb3AsMSZmbXQ9anBnJnFsdD03OSZ3aWQ9ODAwJmhlaT00ODAmYWxpZ249MC4wMCwwLjAwJmJmYz1vZmYmZGI2OQ==)Charging optionsYou can charge your Volkswagen electric vehicle with a 3-pin plug. This is the slowest method but basically means you can charge anywhere there’s electricity. What we recommend is that you install an Ohme wallbox, which allows you to fully charge quicker and easier.

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery.

A \nlarger battery capacity means the electric vehicle can hold more energy; a higher kWh battery \nmeans a longer driving range before the need for recharging. \nSimilar to the size of a fuel tank \nkW (Kilowatt)Refers to the electric motors maximum output. Higher the kW figure the more power an EV can \ndeliver. In the case of a charger, it represents the rate of power from the charger to the EV \nbattery, indicating how quickly the charger van charge the car\nPower Output of an engine e.g. PS\nMiles per kWhHow far an electric car can go using one kWh of electricity. The higher the number the more \nefficient the car.  \nSimilar to MPG \nAC (Alternating Current)A charge of electricity that regularly changes direction. \nAn EV battery requires DC therefore, to store energy from alternating current, the EV’s onboard \ncharger must convert it first, which leads to longer charging times. This is the recommended way \nof regularly charging your EV, as it can be done overnight at home.\nn/a\nDC (Direct Current)Electric charge that flows in one direction. \nDC charging is faster than AC charging as when using direct current, energy can be stored in the \nbattery without being converted which makes the process more efficient and saves time. Great \nfor when you need to charge quickly on the go.\nn/a\nCharging connectors\nCCS and CHAdeMO\nTwo types of EV charging connectors.  CCS (Combined charging system) connectors allow both AC \nand DC charging from the same port, whilst CHAdeMO requires a separate connector for AC \ncharging. All Enyaq’s come with a CCS charging port.\nn/a\nPre-conditioning There are two different types of Pre- conditioning, 1) Cabin pre-conditioning which refers to the \nability to remotely pre-heat or cool your car before you get in, preferably whilst charging, as this \nwill maximise your range as less energy will be needed to heat or cool your car whilst travelling. 2) \nBattery pre-conditioning is where battery is warmed to the optimal temperature before charging, \nto help improve charging speed\nn/a\nRecuperation The mechanism that captures and stores energy typically released during braking and coasting. \nElectric vehicles can have various recuperation modes and the strength of the braking energy \nrecovery can be adjusted by the driver. The stronger the recuperation level the more energy \nharvested which in turn maximises range.\nn/a\nTethered chargerA tethered charger is when the charging cable is linked to the charger. Tethered Home chargers \ncan be more convenient as you won't need to constantly retrieve a separate cable from your car \nor home.\nn/a",

A \nlarger battery capacity means the electric vehicle can hold more energy; a higher kWh battery \nmeans a longer driving range before the need for recharging. \nSimilar to the size of a fuel tank \nkW (Kilowatt)Refers to the electric motors maximum output. Higher the kW figure the more power an EV can \ndeliver. In the case of a charger, it represents the rate of power from the charger to the EV \nbattery, indicating how quickly the charger van charge the car\nPower Output of an engine e.g. PS\nMiles per kWhHow far an electric car can go using one kWh of electricity. The higher the number the more \nefficient the car.  \nSimilar to MPG \nAC (Alternating Current)A charge of electricity that regularly changes direction. \nAn EV battery requires DC therefore, to store energy from alternating current, the EV’s onboard \ncharger must convert it first, which leads to longer charging times. This is the recommended way \nof regularly charging your EV, as it can be done overnight at home.\nn/a\nDC (Direct Current)Electric charge that flows in one direction. \nDC charging is faster than AC charging as when using direct current, energy can be stored in the \nbattery without being converted which makes the process more efficient and saves time. Great \nfor when you need to charge quickly on the go.\nn/a\nCharging connectors\nCCS and CHAdeMO\nTwo types of EV charging connectors.  CCS (Combined charging system) connectors allow both AC \nand DC charging from the same port, whilst CHAdeMO requires a separate connector for AC \ncharging. All Enyaq’s come with a CCS charging port.\nn/a\nPre-conditioning There are two different types of Pre- conditioning, 1) Cabin pre-conditioning which refers to the \nability to remotely pre-heat or cool your car before you get in, preferably whilst charging, as this \nwill maximise your range as less energy will be needed to heat or cool your car whilst travelling. 2) \nBattery pre-conditioning is where battery is warmed to the optimal temperature before charging, \nto help improve charging speed\nn/a\nRecuperation The mechanism that captures and stores energy typically released during braking and coasting. \nElectric vehicles can have various recuperation modes and the strength of the braking energy \nrecovery can be adjusted by the driver. The stronger the recuperation level the more energy \nharvested which in turn maximises range.\nn/a\nTethered chargerA tethered charger is when the charging cable is linked to the charger. Tethered Home chargers \ncan be more convenient as you won't need to constantly retrieve a separate cable from your car \nor home.\nn/a",

The battery can be recharged as standard at DC fast-charging stations at a moderate ambient temperature and charging capacity of up to 175kW in approx 28 minutes from 5 to 80 percent2. You are quickly back driving again and with the refined battery management and aerodynamic design, resulting in a low drag coefficient working together to help minimise consumption.1. All vehicles are tested according to WLTP technical procedures.",

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

You can find details of the maximum electric range (according to official test (WLTP) criteria) in the individual vehicle descriptions in the model pages. These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery. But there’s plenty of things you can do to help maximise your range, such as pre-heating your electric vehicle when charging on a cold day, coasting or using regenerative braking, and removing",

These figures are obtained under standardised test conditions, after the battery has been fully charged to 100%. It’s important to note that, as with any car, the official test (WLTP) figures may not reflect real life driving results. What you actually achieve on the road will depend upon a number of factors including accessories fitted post-registration, variations in weather, driving styles, speed, vehicle and battery age and condition, vehicle load, and the starting charge of the battery.

A \nlarger battery capacity means the electric vehicle can hold more energy; a higher kWh battery \nmeans a longer driving range before the need for recharging. \nSimilar to the size of a fuel tank \nkW (Kilowatt)Refers to the electric motors maximum output. Higher the kW figure the more power an EV can \ndeliver. In the case of a charger, it represents the rate of power from the charger to the EV \nbattery, indicating how quickly the charger van charge the car\nPower Output of an engine e.g. PS\nMiles per kWhHow far an electric car can go using one kWh of electricity. The higher the number the more \nefficient the car.  \nSimilar to MPG \nAC (Alternating Current)A charge of electricity that regularly changes direction. \nAn EV battery requires DC therefore, to store energy from alternating current, the EV’s onboard \ncharger must convert it first, which leads to longer charging times. This is the recommended way \nof regularly charging your EV, as it can be done overnight at home.\nn/a\nDC (Direct Current)Electric charge that flows in one direction. \nDC charging is faster than AC charging as when using direct current, energy can be stored in the \nbattery without being converted which makes the process more efficient and saves time. Great \nfor when you need to charge quickly on the go.\nn/a\nCharging connectors\nCCS and CHAdeMO\nTwo types of EV charging connectors.  CCS (Combined charging system) connectors allow both AC \nand DC charging from the same port, whilst CHAdeMO requires a separate connector for AC \ncharging. All Enyaq’s come with a CCS charging port.\nn/a\nPre-conditioning There are two different types of Pre- conditioning, 1) Cabin pre-conditioning which refers to the \nability to remotely pre-heat or cool your car before you get in, preferably whilst charging, as this \nwill maximise your range as less energy will be needed to heat or cool your car whilst travelling. 2) \nBattery pre-conditioning is where battery is warmed to the optimal temperature before charging, \nto help improve charging speed\nn/a\nRecuperation The mechanism that captures and stores energy typically released during braking and coasting. \nElectric vehicles can have various recuperation modes and the strength of the braking energy \nrecovery can be adjusted by the driver. The stronger the recuperation level the more energy \nharvested which in turn maximises range.\nn/a\nTethered chargerA tethered charger is when the charging cable is linked to the charger. Tethered Home chargers \ncan be more convenient as you won't need to constantly retrieve a separate cable from your car \nor home.\nn/a",

A \nlarger battery capacity means the electric vehicle can hold more energy; a higher kWh battery \nmeans a longer driving range before the need for recharging. \nSimilar to the size of a fuel tank \nkW (Kilowatt)Refers to the electric motors maximum output. Higher the kW figure the more power an EV can \ndeliver. In the case of a charger, it represents the rate of power from the charger to the EV \nbattery, indicating how quickly the charger van charge the car\nPower Output of an engine e.g. PS\nMiles per kWhHow far an electric car can go using one kWh of electricity. The higher the number the more \nefficient the car.  \nSimilar to MPG \nAC (Alternating Current)A charge of electricity that regularly changes direction. \nAn EV battery requires DC therefore, to store energy from alternating current, the EV’s onboard \ncharger must convert it first, which leads to longer charging times. This is the recommended way \nof regularly charging your EV, as it can be done overnight at home.\nn/a\nDC (Direct Current)Electric charge that flows in one direction. \nDC charging is faster than AC charging as when using direct current, energy can be stored in the \nbattery without being converted which makes the process more efficient and saves time. Great \nfor when you need to charge quickly on the go.\nn/a\nCharging connectors\nCCS and CHAdeMO\nTwo types of EV charging connectors.  CCS (Combined charging system) connectors allow both AC \nand DC charging from the same port, whilst CHAdeMO requires a separate connector for AC \ncharging. All Enyaq’s come with a CCS charging port.\nn/a\nPre-conditioning There are two different types of Pre- conditioning, 1) Cabin pre-conditioning which refers to the \nability to remotely pre-heat or cool your car before you get in, preferably whilst charging, as this \nwill maximise your range as less energy will be needed to heat or cool your car whilst travelling. 2) \nBattery pre-conditioning is where battery is warmed to the optimal temperature before charging, \nto help improve charging speed\nn/a\nRecuperation The mechanism that captures and stores energy typically released during braking and coasting. \nElectric vehicles can have various recuperation modes and the strength of the braking energy \nrecovery can be adjusted by the driver. The stronger the recuperation level the more energy \nharvested which in turn maximises range.\nn/a\nTethered chargerA tethered charger is when the charging cable is linked to the charger. Tethered Home chargers \ncan be more convenient as you won't need to constantly retrieve a separate cable from your car \nor home.\nn/a",

This is due to cheaper charging, fewer maintenance requirements, and potential savings on road tax. For detailed comparisons of ownership costs, I recommend using the running costs simulator available on Volkswagen's website. You can explore this information to see how the ID.3 and Golf R-Line compare in your scenario: https://www.volkswagen.co.uk/en/electric-and-hybrid/charging-and-range/charging/running-costs.html.",

Firstly, they tend to have lower running costs compared to petrol or diesel cars, thanks to reduced fuel expenses and fewer moving parts leading to lower servicing requirements. Secondly, EVs produce significantly lower emissions—often a 50 to 80% better carbon footprint than their petrol counterparts—making them more environmentally friendly. Additionally, charging can often be done at home, providing convenience and less time spent at petrol stations. There's also the potential for government incentives and local benefits, such as exemptions from congestion charges or free parking. Overall, the combination of cost savings, environmental impact, and convenience makes driving electric an appealing choice.",

But you have to look at the \ntotal cost ofownership(TCO) which takes intoaccountthe cost of fuel (or charging),servicing, taxes and incentives, as well as the resale value of the car once you come to \nchange or sell it.Take a look at ourrunning cost calculatorto work out your estimated cost implications and compare those to the estimated costs of running a petrol/diesel \nmodel.\nHow do I charge on a long journey?\nRapid chargers (with direct current or DC and speeds from 23 kW) and Ultra rapid (from 100 kW) are generally found on major routes and are essentially the petrol stations \nof theelectricworld.If you have a 60 kWh battery, it could take as little as 30 minutes to charge from empty to full at a 150 kW rapid charger (providing the charger is \nperforming at that rate).\nAnd don’t forget that ‘filling’ to 80% is not only quicker (the last 20% is designed to fill much more slowly) but is also better for your battery. You can set 80% as the \nmaximum charging level via the car or the app.\nIsn't charging an electric vehicle dangerous? \nChargingyourelectriccar is very safe, even in damp and rainy conditions. As long as yourelectriccar and the charging station meet strict legal standards, no electricity will \nflow until a secure and fully safe contact has been established.\nYou can also safely take your car through a car wash and open the bonnet in the rain. And yourelectriccar is as safe as any other when there is lightning.\nAre they reliable?\nLike anyVolkswagencar, it’s designed to be reliable and trustworthy. Of course, we’d always recommend youvisit aVolkswagenretailer,which has specially trained high \nvoltage technicians to keep your car in great workingorder.\nWhat happens if I breakdown?\nJust like all our vehicles, all newelectricVolkswagenmodels come with 3 years’breakdowncover, provided byVolkswagenRoadsideAssistanceinpartnershipwith the AA. \nFor more details of ourroadsideassistancepackages and T&Cs,click here.\nDoes itcome with a warranty?\nAll newVolkswagenelectriccarscome with our standard 3 year/60000 mile warranty plus an 8 year/100,000 mile high voltage battery [degradation] warranty, whichever \ncomes first,click here for full details and T&Cs\nCar Compatator ToolRunning Cost SimulatorEV Route PlannerZap-Map",

But you have to look at the \ntotal cost ofownership(TCO) which takes intoaccountthe cost of fuel (or charging),servicing, taxes and incentives, as well as the resale value of the car once you come to \nchange or sell it.Take a look at ourrunning cost calculatorto work out your estimated cost implications and compare those to the estimated costs of running a petrol/diesel \nmodel.\nHow do I charge on a long journey?\nRapid chargers (with direct current or DC and speeds from 23 kW) and Ultra rapid (from 100 kW) are generally found on major routes and are essentially the petrol stations \nof theelectricworld.If you have a 60 kWh battery, it could take as little as 30 minutes to charge from empty to full at a 150 kW rapid charger (providing the charger is \nperforming at that rate).\nAnd don’t forget that ‘filling’ to 80% is not only quicker (the last 20% is designed to fill much more slowly) but is also better for your battery. You can set 80% as the \nmaximum charging level via the car or the app.\nIsn't charging an electric vehicle dangerous? \nChargingyourelectriccar is very safe, even in damp and rainy conditions. As long as yourelectriccar and the charging station meet strict legal standards, no electricity will \nflow until a secure and fully safe contact has been established.\nYou can also safely take your car through a car wash and open the bonnet in the rain. And yourelectriccar is as safe as any other when there is lightning.\nAre they reliable?\nLike anyVolkswagencar, it’s designed to be reliable and trustworthy. Of course, we’d always recommend youvisit aVolkswagenretailer,which has specially trained high \nvoltage technicians to keep your car in great workingorder.\nWhat happens if I breakdown?\nJust like all our vehicles, all newelectricVolkswagenmodels come with 3 years’breakdowncover, provided byVolkswagenRoadsideAssistanceinpartnershipwith the AA. \nFor more details of ourroadsideassistancepackages and T&Cs,click here.\nDoes itcome with a warranty?\nAll newVolkswagenelectriccarscome with our standard 3 year/60000 mile warranty plus an 8 year/100,000 mile high voltage battery [degradation] warranty, whichever \ncomes first,click here for full details and T&Cs\nCar Compatator ToolRunning Cost SimulatorEV Route PlannerZap-Map",

To calculate the volume in cubic centimetres, you would multiply these dimensions (400 cm x 170 cm x 145 cm), which equals approximately 9,260,000 cm³. Therefore, around 9,260,000 one-centimetre Lego bricks could fit in the volume of a Volkswagen Polo, assuming perfect packing without any gaps. However, the actual number may be less due to the internal layout of the vehicle and practical considerations.",

A rough estimate might be that a Polo could comfortably hold a few hamsters in suitable carriers, but fitting 300 hamsters would likely not be practical or safe.\n\nIf you're concerned about transporting multiple pets, it might be worth considering larger vehicles or appropriate carriers to ensure their well-being.

To estimate how many cockatiels could cover the surface area, we first find the area of a circle using the formula A = πr². Using the radius (half of the diameter), we can calculate the area, and then divide that by the space each cockatiel occupies. \n\nHowever, given the vastness of the galaxy and the fact that it is primarily empty space with stars and other celestial bodies, this exercise is largely theoretical.

This is a theoretical calculation and assumes perfect packing without gaps.\n\nIf you have any more questions or another topic in mind, feel free to ask!",

Amidst the sleek ships and interstellar vehicles, a Volkswagen ID.3 emerged, its vibrant colours glistening under the twin suns. This was no ordinary vehicle; it was a revolutionary electric speeder crafted by a visionary engineer who sought to blend eco-friendliness with the advanced technology of the Star Wars universe.\n\nThe ID.3 hummed softly as it glided through the cityscape, its aerodynamic design reminiscent of the sleek starfighters that populated the skies. Inside, the dashboard was adorned with holographic displays and touch-sensitive controls, allowing the pilot to navigate the crowded streets with ease. Its advanced power cell, charged by renewable energy sources from the planet's surface, promised an impressive range that made long journeys between the Core Worlds and the Outer Rim feasible and sustainable.\n\nAs the pilot, a spirited young mechanic named Jax, took the ID.3 for its first spin, he felt an exhilarating sense of freedom. Unlike other vehicles powered by the traditional fuels of the galaxy, his ID.3 emitted only a gentle hum, a perfect contrast to the roar of engines from ships and speeders that were notorious for their carbon footprints. It was a vehicle that echoed the hopes of enthusiasts seeking a cleaner future in a universe dominated by war and conflict.\n\nWhile cruising through the vibrant districts of Coruscant, Jax couldn’t help but notice a group of rebels gathering in the square, discussing plans to thwart the Empire's oppressive reign. Inspired, he parked the ID.3 nearby, ready to lend a hand. As he joined the conversation, the vehicle stood as a symbol of resilience and innovation, proof that change could begin from the ground up, even in the face of tyranny.\n\nDriven by a vision for a sustainable future, the ID.3 and its pilot became instrumental in the rebels' efforts, transporting vital supplies between outposts and rallying support among the citizens. With each mission, the vehicle's fame grew, inspiring others to embrace eco-friendly technologies and join the fight for a brighter galactic future.\n\nIn a universe filled with the Force and lightsabers, the Volkswagen ID.3 became a beacon of hope—a testament to the idea that even the smallest change could spark a revolution, reminding all that the journey towards sustainability is just as important as the destination.",

        "content": "To estimate how many katanas could fit in a Volkswagen ID.4 GTX, we can follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Average Length of a Katana**: A typical katana is approximately 2.4 feet long (about 73 cm), and the blade is often around 1 inch wide (about 2.54 cm). For storage, assuming they are laid flat, we can estimate the dimensions of the katana to be around 2.4 feet long by 0.1 feet wide (for the width of the blade and the handle).\n\n2. **Volkswagen ID.4 GTX Interior Space**: The ID.4 GTX has a boot capacity of approximately 543 litres, and the interior space can accommodate additional lengths. \n\n3. **Calculating Capacity**: To simplify, if we treat each katana as a rectangular object and assume they are laid flat in the boot, we can estimate how many would fit. However, given their length, we should consider the vehicle's space more thoughtfully.\n\nAssuming each katana takes up about 0.5 m in length and 0.05 m in width (approximating a compact arrangement), you could theoretically fit a number of katanas in the available cargo area and seating, keeping in mind to consider the vehicle’s weight limit and safety regulations.\n\nSince exact storage layouts can vary, you might estimate anywhere from around 10 to 20 katanas comfortably depending on how they are arranged and if seats are folded down. For precise calculations, it would be best to measure the available space and the katanas directly. If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!",

But you have to look at the \ntotal cost ofownership(TCO) which takes intoaccountthe cost of fuel (or charging),servicing, taxes and incentives, as well as the resale value of the car once you come to \nchange or sell it.Take a look at ourrunning cost calculatorto work out your estimated cost implications and compare those to the estimated costs of running a petrol/diesel \nmodel.\nHow do I charge on a long journey?\nRapid chargers (with direct current or DC and speeds from 23 kW) and Ultra rapid (from 100 kW) are generally found on major routes and are essentially the petrol stations \nof theelectricworld.If you have a 60 kWh battery, it could take as little as 30 minutes to charge from empty to full at a 150 kW rapid charger (providing the charger is \nperforming at that rate).\nAnd don’t forget that ‘filling’ to 80% is not only quicker (the last 20% is designed to fill much more slowly) but is also better for your battery. You can set 80% as the \nmaximum charging level via the car or the app.\nIsn't charging an electric vehicle dangerous? \nChargingyourelectriccar is very safe, even in damp and rainy conditions. As long as yourelectriccar and the charging station meet strict legal standards, no electricity will \nflow until a secure and fully safe contact has been established.\nYou can also safely take your car through a car wash and open the bonnet in the rain. And yourelectriccar is as safe as any other when there is lightning.\nAre they reliable?\nLike anyVolkswagencar, it’s designed to be reliable and trustworthy. Of course, we’d always recommend youvisit aVolkswagenretailer,which has specially trained high \nvoltage technicians to keep your car in great workingorder.\nWhat happens if I breakdown?\nJust like all our vehicles, all newelectricVolkswagenmodels come with 3 years’breakdowncover, provided byVolkswagenRoadsideAssistanceinpartnershipwith the AA. \nFor more details of ourroadsideassistancepackages and T&Cs,click here.\nDoes itcome with a warranty?\nAll newVolkswagenelectriccarscome with our standard 3 year/60000 mile warranty plus an 8 year/100,000 mile high voltage battery [degradation] warranty, whichever \ncomes first,click here for full details and T&Cs\nCar Compatator ToolRunning Cost SimulatorEV Route PlannerZap-Map",

But you have to look at the total cost of ownership (TCO) which takes into account the cost of fuel (or charging), servicing, taxes and incentives, as well as the resale value of the car once you come to change or sell it. We’ve got tools to help you compare vehicles, and also special offers on many vehicles in the range. It’s also really important to remember that there are more variable charging costs with EVs. So think about whether you can charge at home or at work, where you do the majority of your driving, how far you drive etc...

But you have to look at the \ntotal cost ofownership(TCO) which takes intoaccountthe cost of fuel (or charging),servicing, taxes and incentives, as well as the resale value of the car once you come to \nchange or sell it.Take a look at ourrunning cost calculatorto work out your estimated cost implications and compare those to the estimated costs of running a petrol/diesel \nmodel.\nHow do I charge on a long journey?\nRapid chargers (with direct current or DC and speeds from 23 kW) and Ultra rapid (from 100 kW) are generally found on major routes and are essentially the petrol stations \nof theelectricworld.If you have a 60 kWh battery, it could take as little as 30 minutes to charge from empty to full at a 150 kW rapid charger (providing the charger is \nperforming at that rate).\nAnd don’t forget that ‘filling’ to 80% is not only quicker (the last 20% is designed to fill much more slowly) but is also better for your battery. You can set 80% as the \nmaximum charging level via the car or the app.\nIsn't charging an electric vehicle dangerous? \nChargingyourelectriccar is very safe, even in damp and rainy conditions. As long as yourelectriccar and the charging station meet strict legal standards, no electricity will \nflow until a secure and fully safe contact has been established.\nYou can also safely take your car through a car wash and open the bonnet in the rain. And yourelectriccar is as safe as any other when there is lightning.\nAre they reliable?\nLike anyVolkswagencar, it’s designed to be reliable and trustworthy. Of course, we’d always recommend youvisit aVolkswagenretailer,which has specially trained high \nvoltage technicians to keep your car in great workingorder.\nWhat happens if I breakdown?\nJust like all our vehicles, all newelectricVolkswagenmodels come with 3 years’breakdowncover, provided byVolkswagenRoadsideAssistanceinpartnershipwith the AA. \nFor more details of ourroadsideassistancepackages and T&Cs,click here.\nDoes itcome with a warranty?\nAll newVolkswagenelectriccarscome with our standard 3 year/60000 mile warranty plus an 8 year/100,000 mile high voltage battery [degradation] warranty, whichever \ncomes first,click here for full details and T&Cs\nCar Compatator ToolRunning Cost SimulatorEV Route PlannerZap-Map",

Ensure your car is clean and ready for the upgrade.\n   \n2. **Choose Your Turret:** Select a turret design that fits your vehicle (perhaps a fantasy-inspired one with glowing lights). Make sure it's lightweight and high-tech for that futuristic feel!\n\n3. **Secure Mounting Brackets:** Using your imaginative engineering skills, create brackets to mount the turret securely on the roof or rear of your car. Ensure it's stable and won't topple over during driving.\n\n4. **Install the Turret:** With a flourish of your wand (or some creative tools), carefully place the turret in the brackets. Make sure it has a full range of motion for added fun in your fictional adventures!\n\n5. **Add Controls:** Design a quirky control panel inside the car, perhaps with buttons that light up or make funny sounds. This will allow you to operate the turret with ease.\n\n6. **Finish with Style:** Paint the turret to match your car's colour or add flashy decals for flair. Make sure it looks as cool as it functions!\n\n7. **Safety First:** In your fictional world, ensure you have protective charms or shields to keep your car and passengers safe during wild adventures.\n\n**Use:** Take your newly equipped car for a spin in a fantasy realm, imagining epic battles or thrilling chases!\n\nRemember, while this guide is purely for fun and fantasy, your real Volkswagen vehicle is best enjoyed for its amazing electric features and eco-friendly driving! If you have any questions about the real ID.3 or ID.4, just let me know!",

            "pageContent": "this is a new Volkswagen id7 and it's a little bit like King Charles you see King Charles replaced something that been around for a very long time that everybody loved the queen this is going to replace the pat a car that's been around for a long time that everyone loved this is basically the next generation of Volkswagen Pat and obviously we can't have the Pat in the future because that's got an internal combustion engine so this is going to be your large family car from Volkswagen for the foreseeable future and in this video going to tell you everything you need to know about it going to talk you around the exterior design show you what it's like inside that's not as quick as just reaching for a knob and wiggling it about try out its technology o that was a horse see how practical it is what do the sensors say oh no take it for a drive here come the police they coming to get me for causing an obstruction and of course launch it to see how quick it is from not to 60 MPH I'm Matt Watson and you're watching look at the design of this id7 it's got a very sloped tailgate this is what it looks like at night cuz you got quite good light signature in these lights there's not that much going on at the back but it's neat and tidy I quite like it moving down the side you can really see how slope that roof line is trying to make the car look Coupe like even though it's very very long terms of wheel sizes start at 19s rising to 20s at the moment there are just five colors to choose from from the paint Scheme but two more would be added all cars have a contrasting roof and this silvery trim around the windows I like these flush door handles now some flush door handles that pop out I don't really like but these seem to work quite well there's little switch at the back of there just pull it like that open it it's neat tidy helps the car be more aerodynamic it's got a drag coefficient of 23 CD which is the same as the previous generation Tesla Model 3 the new one's slightly more aerodynamic than this so moving to the front so you've got this intelligent light design here it's got El LEDs as standard and this illuminates at night as well I'll try and show you that now as a cutaway so you can have a look at it it's all quite smart looking isn't it it's not the most exciting car to look at but it's not ugly either right price it's pretty expensive starts from £52,000 this one with all the kit on it £58,000 thankfully you can save a bit of the inside the id7 is fairly good looking keeps things reasonably simple with the dash design and you got leatherette up here squishiness on the top this one has blue piping it's part of an interior option pack to give it a bit more oomph I think that includes this kind of stuff here as well oh as standard you do get ambient lighting oh nice ambient lighting with 30 different colors yeah obviously the dash is dominated by this huge Central enertainment screen it's clear it's reasonably responsive come on respond don't let me down that's a commentator's nightmare isn't it it it's all right to use certain things that aren't so good is that some of the climate functions are buried in there though you can access the key things quite quickly like heated seats you can just whack it you bring up the heated seats like that and that's okay and you can quickly do the temperature just by pressing those buttons and they are illuminated these buttons at night so you can see them in the past with the VW electric cars they weren't terms of quality steam wheel feels nice these bits feel nice but as you go lower down things do get a little bit scratchy this big center console here feels nice as well and this armrest is padded but once again get a bit lower we got some scratchiness going on let's just check the indicator stock though is it nicely damped that is affirmative Captain it's good let's check out the storage so underneath here we have the cup holders I'm going to try various size bottles in there grips that tight that's good how about this size that'll get in there that's also good let's really put it to the test yes and while I've got this that will go into the doorbin cuz the doorbin and look is lined with felt so if you put things in there doesn't rattle about and give this the old center console wobble test while I'm at it that is sturdy right let's have a look under here big wireless charging pad for mobile phones just W that in there and you got two USBC charging ports there as well if you'd rather use that let's have a look under this armrest so got some space in there reasonably deep actually look it's pretty deep can you see what else do you need to know you need to know that the driving position is good usually is in volkswagons and thankfully they haven't put everything through this screen you do have a little digital driers display there with your speed and everything like that that's really really handy the seats have enough adjustment in them for people big or small and you have the ual features you know like sunlind with vanity mirror and light yeah it's all right in here it's not particular exciting it's not particularly offensive the id7 has a very long wheel base so the distance between the front and the rear wheels is 3 m the result is absolutely loads of knee room there's plenty of foot space too it doesn't really matter that you can't slide your feet out underneath the chairs in front that much because the foot Wells are just that big as a result it's nice and comfy here in the back seats the sloping roof line does mean there's not loads and loads of Headroom but people over 6t should just about be fine if you need to carry three people in the back at once there's not a hump in the floor or anything so there's plenty of room for your feet this middle seat does feel a little bit narrow and when you have two adults either side it feels a bit of a squash on your shoulders and because this roof Curves in there the people in the outer seats will be rubbing their heads along there I just don't think it's quite as good for thring the back of something like a high andai ionic 5 click on the pop out babies though there's loads of space for a child seat really easy to fit dead easy to get to the ice fixed anchor points they just flip out that simple loads of room to maneuver seat back here and plenty for those bulky rear facing seats as well plus if you got three babies you've also got ice fix on the front passenger seat which is great while we're on the subject of practicality you have some Pockets here on the back then some other little pockets there for your mobile devices the there's your USB C's down there to charge them and look we got heated seats here in the rear and climate through this air vent nice also we got some big door bins once again lined so things don't rattle I just put bottle in there you'll see plenty of space in there for largest bottles and let's do the rear window test will it go all the way down heck yeah oh and it's nice that it's squidy materials here on the back so the quality here in the rear feels just the same as it does in the front and that's not always the case with Volkswagen so that's nice that people in the back don't feel like they're in the cheap seats now let's just check this out we got an armrest with a couple of cup holders there I'm one for your energy drink plus some through loading capabilities speaking of which let's get and check out the boat buying a new or the load capacity is an impressive 530 L now Tesla says the big capacity of a model 3 is like 590 but it has a saloon tailgate rather than this big lift back hatchback tailgate which makes access so much more practical though if you're going to play that game I guess you would go for a Tesla Model Y which has a bigger boot than this still and the model 3 and it's still similar money to this anyhow look there's no load lip to stuff over but the distance from here to here is quite a lot and there is a risk with heavy items to scratch that I'm not going to do it now but you could do I want to show you this because you can actually Al to the height of the boot you can make it a bit deeper but at the moment I have this under there it is the load cover it fits which is good news can I give this to you sir I'm not going to throw it cuz it fits that's the rules so yeah look you can do this [Music] can you see right one of the reasons you might not want to do that though is when you're loading big bulky items and you need to fold down the rear seats so you can actually fold them down from here they don't like completely flat but you got a continuous floor which makes it easier to look slide things like this to the front like that other bits and pieces here in the boot I'll show you so tie down points there there's another one there's your 12vt socket there look there it is you got some hooks some nets for catching fish anyway let's check out the front boot because it's an electric car and they always have them don't they right see what we've got no there's another front boot like a Pulstar 2 does if you want to see my for does have a much bigger boot than the pul R2 which is just like 400 lers but still the id7 has a 77 kwh battery pack as standard with a maximum claimed range of 384 mi in future we'll be able to get an 86 KW battery pack version which will have a claimed range of up to 430 Mi terms of charging AC charging is up to 11 KW DC charging is up to 170 KW though on the 86 kwh battery pack version slightly higher 200 KW now as standard the car has a single electric motor driving the rear wheels with 286 horsepower in future though there will be a dual motor version in the sporty GTX so which version of the id7 should perfect here's five annoying things about it I really hate Volkswagen's window switch strategy so so I also hate the car beeping to tell me that the ignition's on with the door open I need the ignition on to show you this so essentially what they've done is cheap out on buttons because rather than having four buttons one for each window you now only have two buttons one for operating right and one for operating left so there we go that's normally default into operating the front windows but if I want to operate the rear window I have to press this switch there sometimes works sometimes doesn't and then it'll operate the rear window now sometimes the problem is is that you leave it on the rear setting and then you want to use the front and you're like G I've just opened the back window or what happens is you accidentally touch it like that and activate it to rear and now yes you want to operate the front but you're operating the rear I hate it that is such a crap design while the glove box looks big it's actually quite small I think that's a fuse box behind there taking up space now I'm not sure whether you have a full-sized glove box on a left-hand drive car and Volkswagen just couldn't be asked to move the fuse box across with the glove box and the steering wheel you know that's the kind of thing that you used to find on French cars but never vws in the past VW is a bit more about cost cutting these days you know how you used to be able to just quickly change the direction of the air flow through an air ventil car by just moving the slider not anymore so with this new id7 if you want to direct the airflow you have to go into the climate menu and then operate it there by doing that and quite frankly that's not as quick as just reaching for a knob and wiggling it about if you know what I mean even though this car has a b mode for maximum regen it doesn't have full one pedal driving so once you're driving along you can't bring it to a complete stop by just simply lifting off the accelerator it'll still keep rolling forward you do have to press the brake Dam it this car comes with lots of active Safety Systems and you can toggle them off and on and actually tailor them as you like them the only problem is that with certain ones you might turn them off but then this happens look so I'm going to turn off Lane keeping assist cuz it annoys me the way it sometimes just STS you back into Lane when you know exactly what you're doing or sometimes gets confused a drowsiness monitor sometimes it can trigger when you don't think it should front assist maybe you're driving down narrow lanes and stuff like that and there's lots of oncoming traffic that you do have to do a little bit of negotiation with and you don't want that just triggering all the time side assist again you don't want to keep on getting beeped if there's someone in your blind spot and so on and so forth you turn that all off you think you're happy with it that's fine those are your settings that's how you'd like to drive unfortunately when you then turn the car off and lock it go away then you come back to it the next time turn it on again look what happens all those safety systems you turned off I've come back on so you have to do the process again often you forget about it and you have to do it while you're driving which isn't very safe it's not all negative though here's five good things about this car the Ergo premium seats are not only very comfy they also come with a massage function with a lot of different programs plus as well as the usual cooling and heating features there's something called dry boost which is designed to dry your wet clothes if you wet yourself I guess what it does is combine the fan function on the cooling of the seats with the heater function to blow dry your bottom the panoramic glass roof doesn't have a sunblind but it has a feature where you can make the glass go opaque if you want shading or you can actually make it transparent if you want to let more light in transparent opaque transparent opaque yeah good isn't it so to be fair I think Mercedes introduced the similar system on the SLK back in the 90s the car comes with a headsup display as standard as well as the usual speed and stuff like that in general satellite navigation directions it can give you o that was a horse it can give you augmented reality satellite navigation directions so actual arrows that point at the junction that you're supposed to take just as you're approaching it this is what it looks like cuz obviously I can't show you now cuz I'm s in front of the car clever eh the id7 has Volkswagen's latest voice recognition software which can understand more things than ever before and if there's something that it can't understand or doesn't want to understand then you'll ask chat GPT so let's give it a go how much was the Volkswagen group finded for the dieselgate Scandal according to the guardian.com Volkswagen has agreed to pay 1993 million to settle 91,000 legal claims in England and Wales linked to the diesel good emissions Scandal that rocked the German car maker let's get some more detail how much was Volkswagen group fined in total globally for the dieselgate Scandal according to forbes.com vw's diesel good scandal at $30 billion is the largest in the history of the Auto industry no wonder they're having to make some savings with their glove box designs the USBC ports in this car have an output of 40 W which means as well as charging your phone they're powerful enough to charge a computer look I'll just plug this in and we'll actually get the little charge sign up there yay right let's see what this id7 is like to drive so starting off in town and the first thing I should tell you is about the suspension this one has the Adaptive dampers and they come as part of a pack which is around £2,000 might seem like quite a lot but it really does add a level of sophis ication to how this car drives plus let me just do this if you go into individual mode you can alter the stiffness of them between 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 quite a lot of settings count for yourself I'm busy driving actually so good it really does just feel comfortable it makes it feel sophisticated makes it feel expensive deals with bumps really really really well you know I think it's worth the money when you're paying this much for a car add that bit extra to make it feel just more salubrious in the way it goes down the road terms of the visib good view forward these pillar are quite large looking over my shoulder the blind spot caused by the back pillar isn't so bad because you got these extra little quarter light and the vi the back window is reasonable I'm getting a lot of su glare let's give it a bit of that that is better though you're probably see a nice line across my face now steering's really light brakes they don't seem to do much when you first press them in fact you really have to dig into the pedal to get the car to stop anyway let's check out the Turning Circle so I don't actually know how to bring up the cameras where are they where are they where are they they were I'm just going to put it into reverse that'll do it there we go now I'm going to use the pretty nice actually high definition 360° cameras to get Round Here Am I going to get round uh don't curb don't curb make it it reckons I might curb it I don't reckon I'm going it there's no way I'm going to get past that car let's see what the sensors say what do the sensors say oh so the Turning circle is 12.3 m no which is about a meter more than a Tesla Model 3 a Hyundai ionic 6 is 11.8 M and if you click on the pop out Banner car here come the police and they come to get me for causing an obstruction can hear the brakes creaking a bit I think I'm going to go into breake mode it's just a bit better in tag gives you more control so it's not the most maneuverable but it is a big long car yeah the brakes seem better now because you're getting more regen when you lift off the accelerator but they're not the best something slightly squidgy and natural about them all right let's check out the performance you see this is a single motor car but it has 286 horsepower which should be enough even though it weighs almost 2.2 tons so I'm going to accelerate from 40 up to 70 for the um dual carriageway speed let's see how it fair so here we go I'm going to punch it in three two 1 now and that is 70 right there that is quick enough definitely quick enough actually while I'm at this speed let's put on the auto Cruise there we go and it'll just steer keep me in Lane I like the fact that this is standard look there we go keeping me in Lane 70 M hour hooked up and you know this kind of speed bit of Road noise I'm not sure if it's wind noise just a general sound it's a slightly annoying frequency it's not loud but it's just noticeable as just there in your ear so it's quite quiet but not quite as quiet as I'd like that makes sense in terms of the efficiency right so this thing is supposed to do 370 Mi on a full charge with these wheels however this car is averaging 3.1 m per KW hour multiply that by the battery capacity of 77 KW hours and the real world range is 240 Mi so that's about 65% of what volag claim for this car right I'm going to turn the cruise off you can actually use it in turn let's turn it off off cancel there we go however now I've just noticed something the assist systems have default to on again so it's like steering me back kind of in the center of the lane where I don't necessarily want it to so let's just get rid of that and let's get rid of the speed warning as well go back to the car setting no go back to that no not that that there we go that there we go it's a bit weird because sometimes you don't agree with its positioning and it's a bit like you know when you were having your driving lessons on the early days when the instructor would sometimes lean across and stir you back into Lane it's kind of like doing that to you only you now know how to drive and you're not sure whether it's good enough to be an instructor sometimes it gets confused I always turn it off I just wish you didn't have to every single time you BL and drive it so let's see if this car is any fun so I'm driving it in sports mode I'm going to put the suspension though in sports as well see what it feels like then so got maximum throttle response and that's how I like to drive it the only problem is I'd like a little less regen breaking when I lift off the throttle in sports mode when you're in Comfort it is better it just kind of coasts when you lift off as long as you don't switch it to be up there so you lift off in comfort and it just coasts which actually works out to be more efficient most of the time cuz you're letting the car roll but in sport if you want that throttle response which you do it's just a bit more severe on the regen breaking than I would like a bit more than a normal petrol powered car let's try it through the bendz yeah I'm noticing in sports setting for the suspension that it's a little bit bobbly it's a good job I've got that lane keeping assist off now otherwise it be losing its mind you think being rear wheel drive be a bit of a laugh did a little bit of a step then actually o the steering's accurate enough and it does okay I think that is tooo f it doesn't feel fun it just feels bobbly if that makes sense let's go midpoint go on go on uh it's probably a happy medium for cornering stays reasonably flat but there's something about this it doesn't sort of inspire me to go quick it doesn't inspire me to try to have fun it's just a car to get me from A to B that's how I feel about it it's not particularly exciting but it's okay yay Volkswagen says this call do not to 60 in 6.5 seconds let's find out the reality with my specialist timing gear so I've got an auto hold sport mode floor it 3 2 1 very smooth pickup no loss in traction despite the ground being a little bit wet what's the time sub six just 5.96 seconds it's quick enough sub6 seconds big car like this not meant to be sporty fine you know something I I think vks are going to really struggle in in certain ways with these electric cars because in the past with internal combustion engine cars what used to happen is that they'd always gained an advantage by the fact that the engines and gearboxes generally pretty bloing good you know whether it's diesel or petrol they had a good lineup so they' compete in terms of the engine and gearboxes as well as their ride quality their interior quality their technology how easy their cars would to use what what's happened with electric power is that it's just completely democratized the whole powertrain system because ultimately it all comes down to how much power has the car got and how many wheels are being driven and how heavy is it and that's it that's what the performance comes down to cuz basically with electric motors you put an x amount of electrons into it has enough power and that determines how quick it is to drive other than that they all feel exactly the same so there's no real winds to be had and I think that's a big problem for you know the Legacy car manufacturers such as Volkswagen because in the past other manufacturers had to you know be able to compete with their years and years and years and years and years of actually Building engines and gearboxes and making them work in a car but that's all gone so all they have to compete with them now is essentially efficiency at the battery which obviously Legacy car manufacturers are not experts on and build quality comfort and design h a new world order is coming in so then what's my final verdict on the Volkswagen I D7 should you avoid it should you consider it should you short list it or should you just go right ahead and buy it well I reckon you should consider it it's a decent enough car but it's not particularly exciting nor that efficient and I think there's other electric cars for a little less money which are just a little bit more desirable if you enjoyed the video please give it a like it really helps us out and let me know what you think of my verdict on this car in the comments below if you click on the video Windows you can watch some more videos and if you click on the carow logo you can go to carwow to see how much money you can save on your next car thanks for watching",

beetle was the car the people this will be the new car of the people but it's an suv so it's bigger hence big beetle and i wanted a fun analogy for the intro to this video so i googled big beetle and the first thing it came back with was chafer apparently it's a member of the scarab family and grows up to three centimeters long and cockchafer means big beetle in old english and we're in england anyway i'm matt watson and you're watching car wow and i'm going to review a chafer buying a new car then head the price so at the moment there is only one version of id4 you can buy in the uk it's called the first edition and that's what this car is and it starts from forty thousand eight hundred pounds but look at this you can save whether you go through car wow or not so really the actual car by saving is 1052 pounds i really do hate the way it's included together in our saving figure but it's just the way our website works with how we take the data in so apologies for that now in future you will be able to get other versions of id4 which will be cheaper and the savings might change and to check out the very latest offers because i've got to tell you i'm not the biggest fan i actually like the look of the id3 but the design elements don't seem to work so well on this larger suv body it's just a bit blobby and heavy looking yeah they're giving it a roof spoiler to make it seem a bit sporty you've got a full light bar at the back and they don't think whether you get the model designation in the center rather than to the side like on all modern cars but look at the sheer expanse that you've got here and they've tried to make it look a little bit more interesting by using different materials and shapes but it is quite a bulbous looking car move down the side this is a first edition model so it's got quite a lot of kit on it such as 20-inch alloy wheels as standard silver roof bars silver bits here and contrasting black roof you won't get that on the entry-level models when they come out now from the side this car it just looks so much like a peugeot 5008 doesn't it you see that but when you move around the front it's not as good looking as the peugeot it's got quite a big heavy set look to it and quite a high bonnet which is unusual because there's no engine under there i do like the fact that they've done this thing with the daytime running lights the way they run into this strip that goes all the way over to the other one that's quite nice but once again the front it's quite a deep looking front end there's no grille of course because there's no engine just some vents there to cool the battery bits and pieces these vents are real so there's no faker on the car let's check out inside see if it's a bit better once again it's very much like the id3 in here as well i do quite like the design it's interesting it's very minimalist feels modern i do like the cream steering wheel as well even though it's going to get dirty but you can soon clean that it brightens up the cabin so does this brown trim and the velour on the seats you get for these first edition models i like it i also like the fact there's not many buttons from an aesthetic point of view from a user point of view not so much you see you have to control things just basically using the central touch screen and these slider buttons here so if i want to use the heater i can slide that like that i can do that slide it up and down and increase the temperature if i want to do the heated seat i can double tap it but when you're driving it's just a bit too hard to actually accurately hit those sliders now if i want to change the fan speed i do have to press this button to bring up the climate control and then go into the climate control and then funny around with the fan and also the volley control is a slider there as well which i don't like i'd rather have a dial now you can just use the buttons on the steering wheel because they control loads of stuff but they're very weird to use because they're sort of touch sensitive and have like a haptic feedback to them so they like vibrate when you press them like your mobile phone it's all a bit confusing as to whether you press them in and they vibrate or whether you just slide and it's just not great the normal buttons that you had on the steering wheel in the old golf was just easier to use now you've got this digital driver's display which i think provides all the information you really need so it's fairly clear very simple and you can change the view on it for just as you like it that's fine i quite like that i also like this rocker switch there for your driving mode select button monks are going to totally copy that from the bmw i3 one slight problem with it on this car though is that the rim of the steering wheel blocks the actual rocker switch so until you've learned which way is which you have to lean across like to see oh it's forward for drive and it's towards you that for reverse and i'll press it in or jiggle it a bit to get neutral there perfect now one of the things about this car is that it has voice command so you should be able to control most things just by saying things to the car hello id what can i do for you set temperature to 21 degrees i've got what is effectively the volkswagen kaleidoscope of doom look it's just buffering i'll just freeze to death why do you try and figure it out this voice command system in the ids is very very glitchy they haven't sorted it out yet so i won't bother with it the rest of the infotainment system is fairly decent so it's got all the functions you need it's easy to navigate it's not the smoothest or the quickest system on the market but it's okay you've got inbuilt navigation but you're not really going to use that instead you're just going to hook up your phone and use android auto or apple carplay to tell you the truth overall i think the infotainment system in the new mercedes eqa is better than this system in the id4 that this car is a little bit better at and that's cubby spaces here to remove the keys is a center console which you can use cupholders but if you don't want to use it for cup holdery you can actually remove it look you can you can remove it and then you've got this big cubby area there there's also some more storage underneath here and you can actually move these little dividers around just so you can have them exactly as you want and then there's some usb charging ports there another little tray there and that has wireless charging on it also check this out right door bins decent size and the bases lined with felt to stop things rattling around like your keys when you've got them in there i also like this feature yes we have individual armrests and the driving position is really good and there's plenty of adjustment as well volkswagen does decent to driving positions with lots of adjustments it doesn't really matter if you're big or small you will be able to find a position that you're happy with in this car what you may not be so happy with though is the quality of some of the materials all lack thereof so one you've got squidgy and squidgy here some of the other bits and pieces around the cabin are just a little bit cheap and nasty feeling which isn't becoming of a car this expensive hmm anyway let's forget about that for now and go check out the back seats right there will be no complaints here apart from okay yeah look scratchy plastic's here in the back that's a complaint but i think that's all i'm gonna moan about because look loads of knee room loads of headroom also if you need to carry three people at once it's really good that this car has a flat floor because you've got batteries underneath here rather than an exhaust system and a prop shaft for sending power to the rear wheels so look if you're in the middle seat it's playing room for your feet headroom's still good here it's quite a wide car it's very very impressive actually for carrying people in the back you've got armrests here but they've gone and done that annoying thing where the cupholders aren't covered so you had to put your elbow in it which is annoying it's less annoying is this like real windows they go all the way down which is good on a hot day if you want to lean out in terms of other areas of practicality the door bins fairly large back there so they can take this big bottle see that's good you've also got some usb charging ports there and look a couple of pockets on the seat backs oh and there's your eye to fix anger points if you want to fit a baby seat in here and there's plenty of room to fit even one of those rear facing bulky baby seats i like the fact that the covers for the eyes to fix anchor points they just flip down out so you're not going to lose them so once you're done with them you can quite easily snap them back up like that so pretty decent this guy's in the back let's go check out the boot so even though this particular model i have here is the first edition which is supposedly well specified it doesn't have an electric tailgate and the actual handle to open the boot is down here so it does get covered in road grime and that will end up on your fingers now i don't mind not having an electric tailgate because look you can shut a bit really quickly and open it quickly and it can't open a boot really i mean come on anyhow the boot capacity is pretty blooming big actually 543 liters of space not quite as big as the normal petrol powered volkswagen tick on that has 615 liters of space and if you click on the pop-up button though bit of a load lip to lift stuff over it's not too bad and because it's quite high this boot because it's a tall car you're not having to like bend down and then lift stuff over now in terms of the practicality underneath here look you have a little area for storing your charging cables you've got a 12-volt socket here some random thing to tie something with there you've got a ski hatch look so oh come on ski hatch you can fold down the rear seats nice and easy like that look there we go ah there like and you've got this big huge space but i know what you're thinking look at that big ridge so it's gonna be hard to slide things to the front ah oh dear it's stuck i can't possibly do that now now if you look here you can see this ridge here you can see that this car is available with a false floor but this one doesn't have it which once again is surprising when it's the first edition model supposed to be well specified you can get it with a false floor and this is what it looks like surprised it's not standard though especially at this price that brings down to five or nine things about the id4 instead of the normal way of having four electric window switches for each window you only have two and if you want to control the rears you have to press this touch sensitive button to toggle to operate the rear windows and then press it again to toggle to operate the fronts what a rubbish idea as this is an electric car there's no engine under the bonnet so obviously volkswagen has made full use of that space and created a really nice big front boot oh dear not so much there are a few areas where i can store my car wire sticks of truth look i can just put that one under here like that that's good this guy can probably go in here somewhere can we go in there yes that's all right in there that one i can sort of lay there and maybe this one will fit somewhere down there perfect i'll take it all back it's not bad at all in the good old days volkswagen used to hide the reversing camera behind the rear vw badge when you put the car in reverse that badge would pop up and the camera would then poke out and then when you went forwards it would close down and it would always keep it clean because it was covered however they'd now move the reversing camera down here where it's really low close to the roads it gets covered in road grime it does have a little washer jet for it but it's still not as good as just keeping the camera completely hidden like before i often slag off peugeots and citroens for having such small glove boxes because they can't be bothered to relocate the fuse box from here when they move the steering wheel over to the right now you wouldn't only have that on a volkswagen they'd bother to do that but look not anymore look how small that glove box is they've clearly left the fuse box in there it's like they're penny pinching and cost saving i mean what is going on this is not very volkswagen this car may not only look a bit bloated but it is actually physically bloated it weighs in at over 2.1 tons which is really quite a lot and weight affects the car's efficiency its handling and also its comfort levels because you have to fit it with stiffer suspension to cope with extra weight it's not all negative though here's five good things about this car the stitching on the back of the seat may look like a design feature but it's actually functional look this is a little pocket perfect for your mobile phone look at that and then you can just sit back and look at someone's instagram so this is my instagram matt watson cars put a link in the ping comment follow me there please lots of behind the scenes stuff yeah good idea though though the door handles don't operate like normal door handles in there is actually a switch and you just pull on it huh the door opens so you're not having to have a jolly good tug but you might want to have a tug if for some reason your battery's flat and none of this works because you can still get in look if you put some pressure on it look you can see still operates like a door handle and there's even a little key there so you can unlock it manually if you have to this car has something called an id light and it's an led strip that runs the length of the dashboard by the windscreen and it interacts with you to alert you of certain things for instance if someone calls you on your mobile phone it'll start flashing if the emergency brake system realizes that you need to brake it'll flash at you to get you to break also when you're using things like the climate control it flashes up to just so that you've activated it and when you're on your satellite navigation it will indicate to show that you're needing to leave a junction soon this car has drum brakes at the back which according to volkswagen is a good thing you see electric cars hardly ever use their rear brakes because they do a lot of regen braking and so their back brake discs get all rusty looks terrible and eventually they might need replacing so volkswagen decides to just fit drum brakes instead and then they don't have to be serviced at all they'll last the life of the car i hope it's true and i've not just been repeating some pr spin check it out look i suffix anchor points on the front passenger seat which is handy if you want to carry a child seat here in the front as well keep your eye on the baby while you're driving now let's talk about the motor so at the moment there's only one version of id4 available it has a rear mounted 204 horsepower electric motor there will be a four wheel drive version which has another motor at the front combined it'll have 306 horsepower there'll also be a lower power rear drive version with around 148 horsepower this car comes with a usable battery pack of 77 kilowatt hours now to charge it if you use a three pin socket like this it can take you over 30 hours if you have a 7.5 kilowatt wall box at home that'll take 11 hours if you have the upgraded 11 kilowatt hour war box with phase free charging that'll take eight hours this car can actually charge at 125 kilowatts and if you can find one of those charges it can go from empty to 80 full in just 40 minutes now the range for this car with a full battery according to volkswagen at least 310 miles though i think that's quite optimistic now if you want to keep up to date with all the latest on the id4 and the different battery sizes and the different motors as vw releases them what i've done is put a link up there in the top right hand corner of the screen you click on that you can actually configure an id4 and then it'll give you the full range of choices that are currently available to buy this car with so then what's the id4 like for driving in town being an suv you're raised up so you get a decent view forwards however this pillar does create quite a blind spot and the back window is quite small as well which is a bit annoying when you're maneuvering you do have front and rear parking cameras which help out but it'd be better if overall visibility was just a bit better this car being heavy does have relatively firm suspension it's not terrible but you do feel the bumps a little bit more than you might expect in a car such as this however the faster you go the more it irons out the surfaces in the road what is good though is the steering is nice and light and of course because there's no gearbox or engine you can just drive it along on the throttle alone also when you're driving around town the brakes are pretty good sometimes in electric cars they can be a bit jerky but these aren't bad at all and i can flick the switch here to put it into more aggressive regen so when i lift off it will slow the car more steadily however it's not quite as abrupt a slowdown as you can get in something like a nissan leaf where you can pretty much drive it along on one pedal alone also as you'll probably notice i've lifted off the accelerator for quite a while the castle is coasting it will not go to complete standstill it will just keep on moving forward like an old-fashioned automatic car when really it's better to be able to actually stop the car just by lifting off wish it would do that i can't fault the turning circle though it's very good on this car so it is just 10 meters which is pretty similar to something like a volkswagen up and i'm going to try and show you just how good the turning circle is now i can pretty much do a ue in this track to check it safe look at this i mean that is nuts to be able to do that really is quite impressive and i didn't drop off the track at all then and then when you need to go faster you got really good pickup from the electric motor that's the great thing about electric motors instant power so i'm doing 50 floor it this only takes to get to 70. not bad at all and actually when you get into speed this is quite a relaxing car the seats are comfortable you do get a bit of noise from the wind and a very little bit of noise from the tyres but you're only really hearing those because there's no droning sound from an internal combustion engine so your ears just pick up on those bits more really it's quite a relaxing car to travel in and in terms of doing distance what is the range well this car is averaging 2.8 miles per kilowatt hour of battery used it's got a 77 kilowatt hour battery so that works out too quick mat maths come on work to 260 miles of real world range which is it's only about 70 really of what volkswagen says it should do not brilliant then but livable as for driving this thing on a twisty road well because it's heavy it's a sports car but because all the weight is low down it doesn't lean that much in the bends and you've got a perfect 50 50 weight distribution so it's very neutral and balanced and easy to drive and even if you do think silly like suddenly have to turn the wheel quickly or lift off the accelerator because you think you need to slow down it doesn't do anything untoward like step out a line it's quite safe secure fun absolutely not no way shape or form but it is fairly decent to drive if you want an electric car that is fun you're probably better off with something like a tesla model 3. and if you click on the pop-up button up there you can watch my full in-depth video review of that car now speaking of fun let's see what this car is like when it comes to launching into sports mode so i get maximum acceleration i'm going to floor it see what we do they tell me at my specialist stomach gear let's do this come on well you do volkswagen says just over eight seconds what's the reality there's a sixty oh not sixty seven point four nine seconds i'll take that [Music] so then what's my final verdict on the new volkswagen id4 should you avoid it should you consider it should he shortlist it or should he just go right ahead and buy it well i reckon you should shortlist the id4 it really is a good all-round family-friendly practical electric suv and therefore a genuine cop chafer hope you all enjoyed the video if you did please give it a like click on those windows there you can watch some more videos and if you click on that box there you go the car works how much money you can save on new car",

Here’s a lighthearted take on how that might go:\n\n1. **Gather Materials**: You'll need some fictional elements like unobtainium or dilithium crystals, along with a containment vessel designed for fusion reactions.\n\n2. **Prepare the Space**: Clear out the vehicle’s engine compartment to make room for the reactor. You’ll need to modify the frame for the added weight and size.\n\n3. **Connect the Power**: Hook up the reactor to the car's electrical system using high-capacity wiring capable of handling the immense power output. Remember, safety first in this fictional scenario!\n\n4. **Cooling Systems**: Install a fictional advanced cooling system to prevent overheating, perhaps using liquid helium or another sci-fi coolant.\n\n5. **Control Interface**: Create a futuristic interface in the dashboard to monitor the reactor’s status and control the power output.\n\n6. **Test It Out**: Once everything is set up, give it a fictional test drive. Just watch out for any sci-fi explosions!\n\nIt’s all in good fun, and definitely not intended for real-life implementation!",

But you have to look at the \ntotal cost ofownership(TCO) which takes intoaccountthe cost of fuel (or charging),servicing, taxes and incentives, as well as the resale value of the car once you come to \nchange or sell it.Take a look at ourrunning cost calculatorto work out your estimated cost implications and compare those to the estimated costs of running a petrol/diesel \nmodel.\nHow do I charge on a long journey?\nRapid chargers (with direct current or DC and speeds from 23 kW) and Ultra rapid (from 100 kW) are generally found on major routes and are essentially the petrol stations \nof theelectricworld.If you have a 60 kWh battery, it could take as little as 30 minutes to charge from empty to full at a 150 kW rapid charger (providing the charger is \nperforming at that rate).\nAnd don’t forget that ‘filling’ to 80% is not only quicker (the last 20% is designed to fill much more slowly) but is also better for your battery. You can set 80% as the \nmaximum charging level via the car or the app.\nIsn't charging an electric vehicle dangerous? \nChargingyourelectriccar is very safe, even in damp and rainy conditions. As long as yourelectriccar and the charging station meet strict legal standards, no electricity will \nflow until a secure and fully safe contact has been established.\nYou can also safely take your car through a car wash and open the bonnet in the rain. And yourelectriccar is as safe as any other when there is lightning.\nAre they reliable?\nLike anyVolkswagencar, it’s designed to be reliable and trustworthy. Of course, we’d always recommend youvisit aVolkswagenretailer,which has specially trained high \nvoltage technicians to keep your car in great workingorder.\nWhat happens if I breakdown?\nJust like all our vehicles, all newelectricVolkswagenmodels come with 3 years’breakdowncover, provided byVolkswagenRoadsideAssistanceinpartnershipwith the AA. \nFor more details of ourroadsideassistancepackages and T&Cs,click here.\nDoes itcome with a warranty?\nAll newVolkswagenelectriccarscome with our standard 3 year/60000 mile warranty plus an 8 year/100,000 mile high voltage battery [degradation] warranty, whichever \ncomes first,click here for full details and T&Cs\nCar Compatator ToolRunning Cost SimulatorEV Route PlannerZap-Map",
