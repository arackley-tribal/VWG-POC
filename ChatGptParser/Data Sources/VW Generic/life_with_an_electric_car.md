# Volkswagen - Life with an electric car

This document outlines volkswagen walk through on owning an electric vehicle over a traditional engine.

## Curious about range?

The average UK daily commute is 19.5 miles1 which means typically you’ll only need to charge your ID. once every few days. Longer journeys are fine too, 269 - 435 miles is the range that our cars are now hitting. If you do need to go further, you’ll just need to plan your charge stops and our charge planner, which is built into the sat nav, can do all that for you. At fast charging stations, you can typically recharge your battery up to 80% in about half an hour2.

## Electric cars are fun to drive

Driving an ID. feels a little like driving an automatic car with two pedals – stop and go. But, with no gears, the drive is super smooth and because the power goes straight to the wheels, you can accelerate effortlessly. Don’t forget, electric cars are quiet, so the peace and calm inside is lovely. When you remove a big engine, you get loads more space in the front, and the lack of drive shaft means that there’s no transmission tunnel (that bump that runs down the centre of a combustion engine car’s interior) so there’s typically more space in the back when compared to a traditional petrol or diesel car. in the back too. No more arguing over who’s going to sit in the middle.

## Smart innovations for you

Volkswagen IDs are packed with clever ideas. For example, Scheduled Charging which allows you to set up your ID vehicle’s charging times so it only charges at certain times of the day when plugged in. This allows you to take full advantage of non-peak charge times. As well as that, every ID. comes with Driver Assist systems to help keep you safer. These are things like Lane Assist which corrects you if you begin to wander out of your lane on the motorway. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) always keeps your car at a safe distance from the traffic ahead.

## Clever inside and out

These cars are packed full of new technology such as a lighting system that communicates with you as well as points you in the right direction, guiding you home and even saying ‘Goodbye’ at the end of your journey. Every ID. has voice control with ChatGPT, just say, ‘Hello ID,’ followed by your command. This makes driving simpler because you don’t need to take your hands off the steering wheel to touch screens or push buttons.

## Simple 3 pin charging

At a very basic level you can charge your ID. with an ordinary 3 pin plug. Whilst this method charges at a more leisurely pace (typically around 2.3kW), it’s reassuring to know you can charge anywhere there’s a 3-pin socket.

Public rapid charge point availability is increasing all the time

## Growing charging network

The public charging network is growing rapidly. Since December 2022, the network has grown by 45% meaning there are now more charging stations in the UK than fuel stations1.

## 80% in 30 mins

Many charging stations across the UK offer super-fast DC charging (typically at 150kW or higher), which allows you to re-charge your ID. battery to 80% in approximately 30 minutes2.

## The same reliable build quality

Within our all-electric ID. range, you can find a car that suits you - no matter your lifestyle. They’re Volkswagens after all, which means they’re as brilliantly engineered, reliable and safe as our combustion engine cars. As well as meeting with the highest standards required to be a Volkswagen, each member of our ID. family comes with a 5-star Euro NCAP safety rating, and it’s not like we’re new to the scene, we’ve been building electric cars since the 70s.

##  Battery guarantee

We guarantee your battery won’t drop below a minimum of 70% of its usable capacity over a period of eight years from new, or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first.

## Fewer moving parts

A Volkswagen ID. has far fewer moving parts than its combustion engine equivalent, which reduces the need for servicing and makes diagnostics much easier, particularly with our Smart Diagnostics and specialist servicing network. To keep you on the road, the entire range comes with fixed 2-year service intervals with unlimited mileage.
