## ID.7 Highlights

### The ID.7 GTX

ID.7 GTX fascinates at first sight – even while stationary. Its sporty four-wheel drive ensures impressive performance and the progressive steering provides you speed-dependent power steering, for pure driving dynamics.

High Performance. High comfort. High Dynamics

The ID.7 GTX gets you there thanks to 4MOTION dual-motor four-wheel drive – with two electric motors that power the front or rear wheels with a 1-speed gearbox. No mechanical link between the axles – for good traction and improved lane guidance, even on slippery terrain.

With the optional adaptive chassis control DCC you can adapt the chassis to your requirements and choose from driving profiles such as sport, comfort or individual.

The long wheelbase makes the ID.7 GTX an interior wonder – with lots of space for five people. Its sporty look continues in many details: The standard GTX seat covers made of fabric, “ArtVelours” Eco microfleece and leatherette, lettering on the front seats, on the steering wheel and the sill panel mouldings as well as red decorative stitching ensure a genuine GTX feeling. The ambient lighting provides just the right light mood – in 30 colours to choose from.
